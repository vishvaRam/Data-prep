It is mainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret the world around us.\n\nThere are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from common experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second, that it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that the speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value in vacuum is *c* = 2.99792458 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> m s\u20131. For many purposes, it suffices to take *c* = 3 \u00d7 10<sup>8</sup> m s\u20131. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest speed attainable in nature.\n\nThe intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to contradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an electromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the spectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the wavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects that we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger). In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be considered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining them. The path is called a *ray* of light, and a bundle of such rays constitutes a *beam* of light.\n\nIn this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction and dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic laws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by plane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to describe the construction and working of some important optical instruments, including the human eye.\n\n### 9.2 REFLECTION OF LIGHT BY SPHERICAL MIRRORS\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 9.1 The incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface lie in the same plane.\n\nWe are familiar with the laws of reflection. The angle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface or the mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle between incident ray and the normal). Also that the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie in the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid at each point on any reflecting surface whether plane or curved. However, we shall restrict our discussion to the special case of curved surfaces, that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case is to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface at the point of incidence. That is, the normal is\n\nalong the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to the point of incidence.\n\nWe have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror is called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre. The line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror is known as the *principal axis*. In the case of spherical lenses, the principal axis is the line joining the optical centre with its principal focus as you will see later.\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_9.jpeg)\n\nTo derive the relevant formulae for reflection by spherical mirrors and refraction by spherical lenses, we must first adopt a sign convention for measuring distances. In this book, we shall follow the *Cartesian sign convention*. According to this convention, all distances are measured from the pole of the mirror or the optical centre of the lens. The distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are taken as positive and those measured in the direction\n\n![](_page_1_Figure_11.jpeg)\n\n#### FIGURE 9.2 The Cartesian Sign Convention.\n\nopposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured upwards with respect to *x*-axis and normal to the principal axis (*x*-axis) of the mirror/lens are taken as positive (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured downwards are taken as negative.\n\nWith a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula for spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle all different cases.\n\n#### 9.2.2 Focal length of spherical mirrors\n\nFigure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident on (a) a concave mirror, and (b) a convex mirror. We assume that the rays are *paraxial*, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror and make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge at a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)]. For a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F on its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F ",

This is also the ratio of the angle subtended by the image to that subtended by the object, if placed at *D* for comfortable viewing. (Note that this is not the angle actually subtended by the object at the eye, which is *h/u.*) What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it allows the object to be brought closer to the eye than *D*.\n\nWe will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity. In this case we will have to obtained the *angular* magnification. Suppose the object has a height *h*. The maximum angle it can subtend, and be clearly visible (without a lens), is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance *D.* The angle subtended is then given by\n\n$$\n\\tan \\theta_o = \\left(\\frac{h}{D}\\right) \\approx \\theta_o \\tag{9.40}\n$$\n\nWe now find the angle subtended at the eye by the image when the object is at *u*.

The angle subtended by the object, when it is at *u = \u2013f*.\n\n$$\n\\theta_i = \\left(\\frac{h}{f}\\right) \\tag{9.41}\n$$\n\nas is clear from Fig. 9.23(c). The angular magnification is, therefore\n\n$$\nm = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_i}{\\theta_o}\\right) = \\frac{D}{f}\n$$\n\\n(9.42)\n\nThis is one less than the magnification when the image is at the near point, Eq. (9.39), but the viewing is more comfortable and the difference in magnification is usually small. In subsequent discussions of optical instruments (microscope and telescope) we shall assume the image to be at infinity.\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 9.24 Ray diagram for the formation of image by a compound microscope.\n\nA simple microscope has a limited maximum magnification (\u00a3 9) for realistic focal lengths. For much larger magnifications, one uses two lenses, one compounding the effect of the other. This is known as a *compound microscope*. A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in Fig. 9.24. The lens nearest the object, called the *objective*, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the *eyepiece*, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.\n\nWe now obtain the magnification due to a compound microscope. The ray diagram of Fig. 9.24 shows that the (linear) magnification due to the objective, namely *h*\u00a2/*h*, equals\n\n$$\nm_o = \\frac{h'}{h} = \\frac{L}{f_o} \\tag{9.43}\n$$\n\nwhere we have used the result\n\n$$\n\\tan \\beta = \\left(\\frac{h}{f_o}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{h'}{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere *h*\u00a2 is the size of the first image, the object size being *h* and *f o* being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance *L,* i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length *f e* ) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.\n\n## Physics\n\nAs the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification *m<sup>e</sup>* due to it [Eq. (9.39)], when the final image is formed at the near point, is\n\n$$\nm_e = \\left(1 + \\frac{D}{f_e}\\right) \\tag{9.44(a)}\n$$\n\nWhen the final image is formed at infinity, the angular magnification due to the eyepiece [Eq. (9.42)] is\n\n$$\nm_e = (D/f_e) \\tag{9.44(b)}\n$$\n\nThus, the total magnification [(according to Eq. (9.33)], when the image is formed at infinity, is\n\n$$\nm = m_o m_e = \\left(\\frac{L}{f_o}\\right)\\left(\\frac{D}{f_e}\\right)\n$$\n\\n(9.45)\n\nClearly, to achieve a large magnification of a *small* object (hence the name microscope), the objective and eyepiece should have small focal lengths. In practice, it is difficult to make the focal length much smaller than 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large.\n\nFor example, with an objective with *f o =* 1.0 cm, and an eyepiece with focal length *f e =* 2.0 cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is\n\n$$\nm = m_o m_e = \\left(\\frac{L}{f_o}\\right)\\left(\\frac{D}{f_e}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\n= \\frac{20}{1} \\times \\frac{25}{2} = 250\n$$\n\nVarious other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to the quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multicomponent lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to improve image quality by minimising various opt",

It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective has a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece. Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed in the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magnifies this image producing a final inverted image. The magnifying power *m* is the ratio of the angle b subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle a which the object subtends at the lens or the eye. Hence\n\n$$\nm \\approx \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} \\approx \\frac{h}{f_e} \\cdot \\frac{f_o}{h} = \\frac{f_o}{f_e}\n$$\n (9.46)\n\nIn this case, the length of the telescope tube is *f <sup>o</sup>+ f<sup>e</sup> .*\n\nTerrestrial telescopes have, in addition, a pair of inverting lenses to make the final image erect. Refracting telescopes can be used both for terrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider a telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece a focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is m = 100/1 = 100.\n\nLet us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1\u00a2 (one minute of arc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 \u00d7 1\u00a2 = 100\u00a2 =1.67\u00b0.\n\n![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nThe main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light gathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly depends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects can be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects distinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on the diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is to make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective in use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin, USA. Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore, difficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult and expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that are free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions.\n\nFor these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather than a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called *reflecting* telescopes. There is no chromatic aberration in a mirror. Mechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs much less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported over its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem with a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside\n\n![](_page_0_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 9.26 Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain).\n\nthe telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right there, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage). This is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt. Palomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the mirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the light being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a convex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes through a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.26. This is known as a *Cassegrain* telescope, after its inventor. It has the advantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope in India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting telescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. The largest reflecting telescopes in the world are the pair of Keck telescopes in Hawaii, USA, with a reflector of 10 metre in diameter.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\n- 1. Reflection is governed by the equation \u00d0*i =* \u00d0*r*\u00a2 and refraction by the Snell's law, sin*i*/sin*r* = *n*, where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted ray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection and refraction are *i, r* \u00a2 and *r*, respectively.\n- 2. The *critical angle of incidence i c* for a ray incident from a denser to rarer medium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90\u00b0. For *i* > *i c ,* total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in diamond (*i c* @ 24.4\u00b0), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some examples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass fibres coated with a thin layer of material of *lower* refractive index. Light incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other, after multiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent.\n- 3*. Cartesian sign convention*: Distances measured in the same direction as the incident light are positive; those measured in the opposite direction are negative. All distances are measured from",

The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and pairs of media at the point of the incidence.\n- 2. The real image of an object placed between *f* and 2*f* from a convex lens can be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is removed, is the image still there? This question puzzles many, because it is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air without a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point on the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging away. The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our eye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in air during a laser show.\n- 3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all rays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is why you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say the page of a book.\n- 4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in colour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours of the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an entirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in white light.\n- 5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the angular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can keep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence have it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see. Without the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at 25 cm which would subtend a very small angle.\n\n## EXERCISES\n\n- 9.1 A small candle, 2.5 cm in size is placed at 27 cm in front of a concave mirror of radius of curvature 36 cm. At what distance from the mirror should a screen be placed in order to obtain a sharp image? Describe the nature and size of the image. If the candle is moved closer to the mirror, how would the screen have to be moved?\n- 9.2 A 4.5 cm needle is placed 12 cm away from a convex mirror of focal length 15 cm.

If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making some angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or appear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal axis. This is called the *focal plane* of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)].\n\n![](_page_2_Figure_5.jpeg)\n\nThe distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called the *focal length* of the mirror, denoted by *f*. We now show that *f* = *R*/2, where *R* is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry of reflection of an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4.\n\nLet C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a ray parallel to the principal axis striking the mirror at M. Then CM will be perpendicular to the mirror at M. Let q be the angle of incidence, and MD\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_0.jpeg)\n\nPhysics\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_1.jpeg)\n\nFIGURE 9.4 Geometry of reflection of an incident ray on (a) concave spherical mirror, and (b) convex spherical mirror.\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_3.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_3_Figure_4.jpeg)\n\nbe the perpendicular from M on the principal axis.

Therefore, Eq. (9.1) gives\n\n$$\n\\frac{MD}{FD} = 2 \\frac{MD}{CD}\n$$\n  \nor, FD =  $\\frac{CD}{2}$  (9.2)\n\nNow, for small q, the point D is very close to the point P. Therefore, FD = *f* and CD = *R.* Equation (9.2) then gives *f = R/*2 (9.3)\n\n#### 9.2.3 The mirror equation\n\nIf rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point after reflection and/or refraction, that point is called the *image* of the first point. The image is *real* if the rays actually converge to the point; it is *virtual* if the rays do not actually meet but\n\n> appear to diverge from the point when produced backwards. An image is thus a point-to-point correspondence with the object established through reflection and/or refraction.\n\n> In principle, we can take any two rays emanating from a point on an object, trace their paths, find their point of intersection and thus, obtain the image of the point due to reflection at a spherical mirror. In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two of the following rays:\n\n- (i) The ray from the point which is parallel to the principal axis. The reflected ray goes through the focus of the mirror.\n- (ii) The ray passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror or appearing to pass through it for a convex mirror. The reflected ray simply retraces the path.\n- (iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave mirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus of a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis.\n- (iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows laws of reflection.\n\nFigure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows the image A\u00a2B\u00a2 (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave mirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A. An infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions. Thus, point A\u00a2 is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and falling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A\u00a2.\n\nWe now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object distance (*u*), image distance (*v*) and the focal length (*f* ).\n\nFrom Fig. 9.5, the two right-angled triangles A\u00a2B\u00a2F and MPF are similar. (For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line perpendicular to CP.) Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{B'A'}{PM} = \\frac{B'F}{FP}\n$$\n  \nor \n$$\n\\frac{B'A'}{BA} = \\frac{B'F}{FP} \\quad (\\because PM = AB)\n$$\n (9.4)\n\nSince \u00d0 APB = \u00d0 A\u00a2PB\u00a2, the right angled triangles A\u00a2B\u00a2P and ABP are also similar. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\frac{B'A'}{BA} = \\frac{B'P}{BP}\n$$\n (9.5)\n\nComparing Eqs. (9.4) and (9.5), we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{B'F}{FP} = \\frac{B'P - FP}{FP} = \\frac{B'P}{BP}\n$$\n\\n(9.6)\n\nEquation (9.6) is a relation involving magnitude of distances. We now apply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to the mirror MPN. Hence this is taken as the positive direction. To reach the object AB, image A\u00a2B\u00a2 as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have to travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three will have negative signs. Thus,\n\nB\u00a2 P = \u2013*v*, FP = \u2013*f*, BP = \u2013*u* Using these in Eq. (9.6), we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{-v+f}{-f} = \\frac{-v}{-u}\n$$\n  \nor \n$$\n\\frac{v-f}{f} = \\frac{v}{u}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\frac{v}{f} = 1 + \\frac{v}{u}\n$$\n\nDividing it by *v*, we get\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v} + \\frac{1}{u} = \\frac{1}{f}\n$$\n (9.7)\n\nThis relation is known as the *mirror equation*.\n\nThe size of the image relative to the size of the object is another important quantity to consider. We define linear *magnification* (*m*) as the ratio of the height of the image (*h*\u00a2) to the height of the",
