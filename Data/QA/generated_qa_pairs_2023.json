The facility allows a market participant to define a range i.e., a maximum and a minimum value for bids they intend to submit in an auction. The range can be set in either price or yield terms, for each security in every auction, which can be set before the auction and can also be modified during the auction. Once the limits are set by the participating entity, the bids in the auction are automatically validated against the set limits. This is expected to eliminate instances of Fat-finger / Big-figure error by the bidders in the G-Sec auctions.\n\n2. As there have been a few instances of Fat-finger / Big-figure error by the bidders in the G-Sec auctions conducted by Reserve Bank, it suggests that some of the market participants are yet to put in place the \"Price / Yield range setting\" facility in their system.\n\n3. All the market participants are, therefore, advised to utilize the \"Price / Yield range setting\" facility provided on the e-Kuber platform before placing bids in the Primary Market auctions. It may be noted that no request for cancellation of bids will be entertained after the close of auction window.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(S Venkataraman) General Manager",

In terms of paragraph 2.1.1 of the said circular, banks were required to renew their locker agreements with existing locker customers by January 1, 2023. However, it has come to the notice of the Reserve Bank that large number of customers are yet to execute the revised agreement and are facing difficulties in doing the same. In many cases, the banks are yet to inform the customers about the need for renewal of agreements before January 1, 2023. Further, there is a need for revision in the Model Agreement drafted by the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) to fully comply with the revised instructions.\n\n3. Considering the above aspects, the deadline for banks is being extended in a phased manner to December 31, 2023. Banks are advised to notify all their customers of the revised requirements by April 30, 2023 and ensure that at least 50 per cent and 75 per cent of their existing customers have executed the revised agreements by June 30 and September 30, 2023 respectively. Banks shall report the status of compliance with these instructions on the [DAKSH](https://prism.rbi.org.in/DAKSH/portal/#/login) supervisory portal of the Reserve Bank on a monthly basis.\n\n4. IBA is being advised separately to review and revise the Model Agreement to ensure that it complies with the requirements of [circular dated August 18, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12146&Mode=0) and circulate a revised version to all banks by February 28, 2023.

The contributions to the FCRA account are received directly from foreign banks through SWIFT and from Indian intermediary banks through NEFT and RTGS systems.\n\n2. In terms of extant requirements of Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India, the donor details such as name, address, country of origin, amount, currency, and purpose of remittance are required to be captured in such transactions and SBI is required to report the same to MHA on daily basis.\n\n3.

The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises ('MSME'), Government of India has launched the Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) to facilitate formalisation of Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) through online generation of Udyam Assist Certificate. Registration on the platform is done with the assistance of Designated Agencies which are RBI regulated entities (including scheduled commercial banks, non-banking financial companies, etc.).\n\n3. The Government of India, vide [Gazette Notification S.O. 1296\\(E\\) dated March 20, 2023,](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/IndianGazzate20032023.pdf) has specified that the certificate issued on the UAP to IMEs shall be treated at par with Udyam Registration Certificate for the purpose of availing Priority Sector Lending (PSL) benefits.\n\n4. Government of India has clarified to RBI that IMEs are those enterprises which are unable to get registered on the Udyam Registration Portal (URP) due to lack of mandatory required documents such as Permanent Account Number (PAN) or Goods and Services\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nTax Identification Number (GSTIN). Hence such enterprises are unable to avail the benefits of Government schemes or programmes. Further, it has been clarified that the turnover of enterprises exempted from filing returns under the provisions of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 shall be the sole criterion to be defined as IMEs for the purpose of UAP. Accordingly, IMEs are those enterprises that are not covered in the Goods and Services Tax regime.\n\n5. An interface has been created between the UAP and Udyam Registration Portal (URP) to enable the transition and migration of the IMEs from UAP to URP, once IMEs obtain the mandatorily required documents.\n\n6. In view of the aforementioned notification and clarification, IMEs with an Udyam Assist Certificate shall be treated as Micro Enterprises under MSME for the purposes of PSL classification.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n(Nisha Nambiar) Chief General Manager",

The revised regulatory framework for IDF-NBFCs is provided in the **[Annex.](#page-1-0)** These guidelines shall come into effect from the date of this circular.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(J.P. Sharma) Chief General Manager\n\n#### **Annex**\n\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>An IDF is set up either as a trust or as a company. A trust based IDF is registered as an IDF-Mutual Fund (IDF-MF) and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) whereas a company based IDF is registered as an IDF-NBFC and is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\n#### **2. Definition**\n\nAn IDF-NBFC means a non-deposit taking NBFC which is permitted to \u2013 (i) refinance post commencement operations date (COD) infrastructure projects that have completed at least one year of satisfactory commercial operations; and (ii) finance toll operate transfer (TOT) projects as the direct lender.\n\n### **3. Net owned funds (NOF) and regulatory capital**\n\nAn IDF-NBFC shall be required to have an NOF of at least \u20b9300 crore and capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR) of minimum 15 per cent (with minimum Tier 1 capital of 10 per cent).\n\n## **4. Raising of funds**\n\n- (i) IDF-NBFC shall raise funds through issue of either rupee or dollar denominated bonds of minimum five-year maturity. With a view to facilitate better asset-liability management (ALM), IDF-NBFCs can raise funds through shorter tenor bonds and commercial papers (CPs) from the domestic market to the extent of up to 10 per cent of their total outstanding borrowings.\n- (ii) In addition to the bond route, IDF-NBFCs can also raise funds through loan route under external commercial borrowings (ECBs). However, such borrowings shall be subject to minimum tenor of five years and the ECB loans should not be sourced from foreign branches of Indian banks.\n- (iii) Regarding ECBs, IDF-NBFCs shall also be required to adhere to the guidelines issued by the Foreign Exchange Department of the RBI.\n\n# **5. Exposure limits**\n\nThe exposure limits for IDF-NBFCs shall be 30% of their Tier 1 capital for single borrower/ party and 50% of their Tier 1 capital for single group of borrowers/ parties.\n\n## **6. Risk weights**\n\nFor computing CRAR of the IDF-NBFCs, their assets shall be risk-weighted as per riskweights applicable to NBFC-Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICCs).\n\n# **7. Requirements of a sponsor and tripartite agreement**\n\n7.1 Under the earlier guidelines, an IDF-NBFC was required to be sponsored by a bank or an NBFC-Infrastructure Finance Company (NBFC-IFC). The requirement of a sponsor for an IDF-NBFC has now been withdrawn and shareholders of IDF-NBFCs shall be subjected to scrutiny as applicable to other NBFCs, including NBFC-IFCs.\n\n7.2 Earlier, IDF-NBFCs were required to enter into a tripartite agreement with the concessionaire and the project authority for investments in the Public Private Partnership (PPP) infrastructure projects having a project authority. The requirement of the tripartite agreement has now been made optional.\n\n# **8. Other regulatory norms**\n\nAll other regulatory norms including income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms as applicable to NBFC-ICCs shall be applicable to IDF-NBFCs.\n\n# **9. Guidelines governing sponsorship of IDF-MFs by NBFCs**\n\n9.1 All NBFCs shall be eligible to sponsor (sponsorship as defined by SEBI Regulations for Mutual Funds) IDF-MFs with prior approval of the RBI subject to the following conditions (based on the audited financial statements), in addition to those prescribed by SEBI:\n\n- (i) The NBFC shall have a minimum NOF of \u20b9300 crore and CRAR of 15 percent;\n- (ii) Its net NPAs shall be less than 3 per cent of the net advances;\n- (iii) It shall have been in existence for at least 5 years;\n- (iv)It shall be earning profits for the last three years and its performance shall be satisfactory;\n- (v) The CRAR of the NBFC post investment in the IDF-MF shall not be less than the regulatory minimum prescribed for it;\n- (vi)The NBFC shall continue to maintain the required level of NOF after accounting for investment in the proposed IDF-MF;\n- (vii) There shall be no supervisory concerns with respect to the NBFC.\n\n9.2 NBFCs that fulfil the eligibility criteria as above shall approach the Department of Regulation of the RBI, for prior approval to sponsor IDF-MFs.",

However, certain transactions of REs involving AIFs that raise regulatory concerns have come to our notice. These transactions entail substitution of direct loan exposure of REs to borrowers, with indirect exposure through investments in units of AIFs.\n\n2. In order to address concerns relating to possible evergreening through this route, it is advised as under:\n\n(i) REs shall not make investments in any scheme of AIFs which has downstream investments either directly or indirectly in a debtor company of the RE. *Explanation: The debtor company of the RE, for this purpose, shall mean any* \n\n*company to which the RE currently has or previously had a loan or investment exposure anytime during the preceding 12 months.*\n\n- (ii) If an AIF scheme, in which RE is already an investor, makes a downstream investment in any such debtor company, then the RE shall liquidate its investment in the scheme within 30 days from the date of such downstream investment by the AIF. If REs have already invested into such schemes having downstream investment in their debtor companies as on date, the 30-day period for liquidation shall be counted from date of issuance of this circular. REs shall forthwith arrange to advise the AIFs suitably in the matter.\n- (iii) In case REs are not able to liquidate their investments within the above-prescribed time limit, they shall make 100 percent provision on such investments.\n\n3. In addition, investment by REs in the subordinated units of any AIF scheme with a 'priority distribution model' shall be subject to full deduction from RE's capital funds.\n\n*Explanation: 'Priority distribution model' shall have the same meaning as specified in the SEBI circular SEBI/HO/AFD-1/PoD/P/CIR/2022/157 dated November 23, 2022.* \n\n4. These instructions have been issued in exercise of the powers conferred by the Sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and Sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987.\n\n5. The above instructions shall become effective immediately.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Vaibhav Chaturvedi) Chief General Manager",

A cooperative bank desirous of change in its name shall approach the Department of Supervision (DoS) of the concerned Regional Office (DoS, Central Office in case of Cooperative Banks coming under the purview of Mumbai Office) of the Reserve Bank of India for grant of no objection certificate (NOC) under Sections 49B and 49C of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 ('BR Act'), clearly stating the reason/s for such change (as per format given in [Annex \u2013](#page-3-0) 2). The approval of the General Body of the bank shall be mandatory at the time of submitting such requests to RBI.\n\n2. NOC from RBI under section 49C read with section 56 of BR Act, 1949 will be necessary only in case there is a requirement for 'confirmation' from Central/State Government, one or more authority/authorities for alteration of bye-laws under the applicable Co-operative Act /Rules. It will be mandatory for a co-operative bank to give a declaration in writing regarding above mentioned requirement for 'confirmation' under the applicable Co-operative Act /Rules while submitting its request to RBI.\n\n3. It may be noted that the cooperative banks shall submit their requests for change of name and bye-laws, only when these are supported by valid and compelling reason/s for the proposed change. It may be noted that RBI shall have the discretion to assess whether the reason/s submitted by the bank are valid and compelling.\n\n4. After getting NOC from the concerned office of the Reserve Bank, the Co-operative banks will approach the Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies (CRCS) or Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS)[1](#page-1-1) for amendment in their bye-laws. Once the approval is obtained from CRCS/RCS, the Co-operative Banks will apply to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank with the following documents:\n\n- i. Approval of Board of Directors\n- ii. Approval of General Body of the Bank\n- iii. Amended bye-laws as approved by CRCS/RCS\n- iv. Copy of CoR issued by CRCS/RCS with amended name\n- v. Original banking licence\n\n<span id=\"page-1-1\"></span> <sup>1</sup> As the case may be, under the law under which a co-operative bank is registered.\n\n![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n5.

No co-operative bank shall display/operate with amended name without effecting the corresponding change in its name in the banking licence issued by the Reserve Bank of India. Further, the displayed name of the bank shall be strictly as per the name in its banking licence.\n\n![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n**Annex \u2013 2**\n\n### **Details to be submitted to Regional Office of RBI**\n\n<span id=\"page-3-0\"></span>\n\n![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\n",

The high growth seen in consumer credit and increasing dependency of NBFCs on bank borrowings were also highlighted by Governor in the interactions with MD/CEOs of major banks and large NBFCs in July and August 2023, respectively.\n\n2. In this context, it has been decided to effect the following measures as under:\n\n# **A. Consumer credit exposure**\n\n#### (a) Consumer credit exposure of commercial banks\n\nAs per extant instructions applicable to commercial banks[1,](#page-0-0) consumer credit attracts a risk weight of 100%. On a review, it has been decided to increase the risk weights in respect of consumer credit exposure of commercial banks (outstanding as well as new), including personal loans, but excluding housing loans, education loans, vehicle loans and loans secured by gold and gold jewellery, by 25 percentage points to 125%.\n\n<span id=\"page-0-0\"></span> <sup>1</sup> Para 5.13.3 of 'Master Circular \u2013 [Basel III Capital Regulations'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12504) and [circular 'Risk Weight for Consumer Credit](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11684&Mode=0)  [except credit card receivables' dated September 12, 2019](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11684&Mode=0)\n\n## (b) Consumer credit exposure of NBFCs\n\nIn terms of extant norms, NBFCs' loan exposures generally attract a risk weight of 100%[2.](#page-1-0) On a review, it has been decided that the consumer credit exposure of NBFCs (outstanding as well as new) categorised as retail loans, excluding housing loans, educational loans, vehicle loans, loans against gold jewellery and microfinance/SHG loans, shall attract a risk weight of 125%.\n\n## (c) Credit card receivables\n\nAs per extant instructions, credit card receivables of scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) attract a risk weight of 125%[3](#page-1-1) while that of NBFCs attract a risk weight of 100%[4.](#page-1-2) On a review, it has been decided to increase the risk weights on such exposures by 25 percentage points to 150% and 125% for SCBs and NBFCs respectively.\n\n# **B.

For this purpose, loans to HFCs, and loans to NBFCs which are eligible for classification as priority sector in terms of the extant instructions shall be excluded.\n\n## **C.

Further, the banks have also been permitted to offer differential rate on interest on TDs based on non-callability of deposits (i.e., non-availability of premature withdrawal option) in addition to tenor and size of deposits.\n\n2.

However, in respect of EMI based floating rate personal loans, in the wake of rising interest rates, several consumer grievances related to elongation of loan tenor and/or increase in EMI amount, without proper communication with and/or consent of the borrowers have been received. In order to address these concerns, the REs are advised to put in place an appropriate policy framework meeting the following requirements for implementation and compliance:\n\n- (i) At the time of sanction, REs shall clearly communicate to the borrowers about the possible impact of change in benchmark interest rate on the loan leading to changes in EMI and/or tenor or both. Subsequently, any increase in the EMI/ tenor or both on account of the above shall be communicated to the borrower immediately through appropriate channels.\n- (ii) At the time of reset of interest rates, REs shall provide the option to the borrowers to switch over to a fixed rate as per their Board approved policy. The policy, inter alia, may also specify the number of times a borrower will be allowed to switch during the tenor of the loan.\n- (iii) The borrowers shall also be given the choice to opt for (i) enhancement in EMI or elongation of tenor or for a combination of both options; and, (ii) to prepay, either in part or in full, at any point during the tenor of the loan. Levy of foreclosure charges/ pre-payment penalty shall be subject to extant instructions.\n- (iv) All applicable charges for switching of loans from floating to fixed rate and any other service charges/ administrative costs incidental to the exercise of the above options shall be transparently disclosed in the sanction letter and also at the time of revision of such charges/ costs by the REs from time to time.\n- (v) REs shall ensure that the elongation of tenor in case of floating rate loan does not result in negative amortisation.\n- (vi) REs shall share / make accessible to the borrowers, through appropriate channels, a statement at the end of each quarter which shall at the\n\nminimum, enumerate the principal and interest recovered till date, EMI amount, number of EMIs left and annualized rate of interest / Annual Percentage",

All applicable charges for switching from floating to fixed rates, along with any other service or administrative costs, must be transparently disclosed in the sanction letter and whenever these charges are revised.

The guidelines allow financing / discounting of MSME receivables on \"without recourse\" basis by permitted financiers. Currently, three entities operate TReDS platforms in the country; one more entity has also been given in-principle authorisation to operate such platform.\n\n2. Based on the experience gained, and as announced in the [Statement on Developmental](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55179) [and Regulatory Policies dated February 8,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55179) 2023, it has been decided to make the following enhancements to the TReDS guidelines :\n\n- a) Facilitate insurance for transactions : Financiers place their bids on the TReDS platforms keeping in view the credit rating of buyers. They are generally not inclined to bid for payables of low rated buyers. To overcome this, insurance facility is being permitted for TReDS transactions, which would aid financiers to hedge default risks, subject to the following:\n\t- i. Apart from MSME sellers, buyers and financiers, insurance companies are permitted to participate as \"fourth participant\" in TReDS.\n\t- ii. In their business / operational rules, the TReDS platform operators may specify the stage at which insurance facility can be availed.\n\t- iii. Premium for insurance shall not be levied on the MSME seller.\n\nDepartment of Payment and Settlement Systems, Central Office, 14th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai -\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_17.jpeg)\n\n- iv. Collection of premium and related activities could be enabled through National Automated Clearing House (NACH) system used for settlement of TReDS transactions.\n- v. Based on consent received from financiers and insurance companies, TReDS platforms could facilitate automated processing of insurance claims and specify timelines for their settlement through the NACH system.\n- vi. As of now, the credit insurance shall not be treated as a Credit Risk Mitigant (CRM) to avail any prudential benefits.\n- b) Expand the pool of financiers : TReDS transactions fall under the ambit of \"factoring business\", and banks, NBFC-Factors and other financial institutions (as permitted by RBI) can presently participate as financiers in TReDS. The Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 (FRA) allows certain other entities / institutions to undertake factoring transactions. Accordingly, all entities / institutions allowed to undertake factoring business under FRA and the rules / regulations made thereunder, are now permitted to participate as financiers in TReDS. This would augment availability of financiers on TReDS platforms.\n- c) Enable secondary market for Factoring Units (FUs) : TReDS guidelines provide for the discounted / financed FUs to have a secondary market, which is, however, not introduced yet. Given the experience gained, TReDS platform operators may, at their discretion, enable a secondary market for transfer of FUs within the same TReDS platform. Such transfers shall, however, be subject to the applicable provisions of RBI's '*[Master Direction \u2013 Reserve](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12166)  [Bank of India \\(Transfer of Loan Exposures\\) Directions, 2021'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12166)* dated September 24, 2021 (as updated from time to time), including the eligibility of transferor / transferee as specified in paragraph 3 of the said Master Direction.\n- d) Settlement of FUs not discounted / financed : On an average, 17% of FUs uploaded on TReDS platforms are not discounted / financed; for such FUs, TReDS guidelines require buyers to pay MSME sellers outside the system. To overcome the inconvenience caused to MSME sellers and buyers as well as for better reconciliation, TReDS platform operators shall now be permitted to undertake settlement of all FUs \u2013 *financed / discounted or otherwise* \u2013 using the NACH mechanism used for TReDS. Timeline for funds settlement shall be subject to the provisions of TReDS guidelines (under reference) as well as other relevant statutes like the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006.\n- e) Display of bids : TReDS platforms facilitate transparent and competitive bidding by the financiers. To make the process more transparent, the platforms may display details of bids placed for an FU to other bidders; name of the bidder shall, however, not be revealed.\n\n3. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(P.

TReDS platforms can specify when the insurance facility can be availed in their business rules. The premium for insurance should not be levied on the MSME seller.

The provisions of this framework shall be applicable to all REs to which this circular is addressed and shall be without prejudice to the provisions of the Prudential Framework, or any other guidelines applicable to the REs on resolution of stressed assets.\n\n3. These instructions on operationalising the framework have been issued in exercise of the powers conferred by the Sections 21 and 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949; Chapter IIIB of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and Sections 30A, 32 and 33 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987.

The Board approved policy shall comprehensively lay down the process to be followed for all compromise settlements and technical write-offs, with specific guidance on the necessary conditions precedent such as minimum ageing, deterioration in collateral value etc. The policies shall also put in place a graded framework for examination of staff accountability in such cases with reasonable thresholds and timelines as may be decided by the Board.\n- 3. In respect of compromise settlements, the policy shall *inter alia* contain provisions relating to permissible sacrifice for various categories of exposures while arriving at the settlement amount, after prudently reckoning the current realisable value of security/collateral, where available. The methodology for arriving at the realisable value of the security shall also form part of the policy. The objective shall be to maximise the possible recovery from a distressed borrower at minimum expense, in the best interest of the RE.\n- 4.

With the concerted efforts of banks/FIs as well as industry associations like the Indian Banks' Association, a smooth transition with respect to LIBOR settings that have ceased to be published/become non-representative after December 31, 2021 has been achieved. The transition away from LIBOR was also facilitated by the continuing publication of US\\$ LIBOR settings in five tenors which provided a longer transition period particularly for the insertion of the fallback clauses in legacy financial contracts that reference LIBOR. New transactions are now predominantly undertaken using ARRs such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Modified\n\n\ufffd\u0935\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940\u092f \u092c\u093e\u091c\u093c\u093e\u0930 \ufffd\u0935\ufffd\u0928\u092f\u092e\u0928 \ufffd\u0935\u092d\u093e\u0917, \u0915\ufffd\u0926\u094d\u0930\ufffd\u092f \u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0932\u092f, \u092a\u0939\u0932\ufffd \u092e\u0902\u093f\u091c\u0932, \u092e\u0941 \u0916\u094d\u092f \u092d\u0935\u0928, \u0936\u0939\ufffd\u0926 \u092d\u0917\u0924 \ufffd\u0938 \u0902\u0939 \u092e\u093e\u0917\u0930\u094d, \u092b\u094b\u091f\u0930\u094d, \u092e\u0941\u0902\u092c\u0908 \u2013 400 001, \u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 Financial Markets Regulation Department, Central Office, 9th Floor, Central Office Building, Shahid Bhagat Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai \u2013 400 001, India \u092b\u094b\u0928/Tel: (91-22) 2260 3000, \u092b\u0948 \u0915\u094d\u0938/Fax: (91-22) 22702290, \u0908-\u092e\u0947\u0932 /E-Mail: cgmfmrd@rbi.org.in\n\n![](_page_0_Picture_13.jpeg)\n\n![](_page_1_Picture_0.jpeg)\n\nMumbai Interbank Forward Outright Rate (MMIFOR). At the same time, there have been instances of a few US\\$ LIBOR linked financial contracts undertaken/facilitated by banks/FIs after January 1, 2022. Also, while banks have reported that substantial progress has been made towards insertion of fallback clauses, the process is yet to be completed for all contracts where such fallbacks are required to be inserted.\n\n3. After June 30, 2023, the publication of the remaining five US\\$ LIBOR settings will cease permanently. While certain synthetic LIBOR settings will continue to be published after June 30, 2023, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), UK, which regulates the LIBOR, has made it clear that these settings are not meant to be used in new financial contracts. The MIFOR, a domestic interest rate benchmark reliant on US\\$ LIBOR, will also cease to be published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd. (FBIL) after June 30, 2023.\n\n4. Banks/FIs are advised to ensure that no new transaction undertaken by them or their customers rely on or are priced using the US\\$ LIBOR or the MIFOR. Banks/FIs are also advised to take all necessary steps to ensure insertion of fallbacks in all remaining legacy financial contracts that reference US\\$ LIBOR (including transactions that reference MIFOR). Fallbacks in such contracts should be inserted at the earliest so as to ensure that transition of any remaining US\\$ LIBOR-linked contracts is completed well before the deadline of end June 2023 and any disruptions due to a last-minute rush to insert fallbacks is avoided. Banks/FIs are advised not to rely on the availability of synthetic LIBOR rates as a substitute for fallbacks in legacy contracts.\n\n5. Banks/FIs are expected to have developed the systems and processes to manage the complete transition away from LIBOR from July 1, 2023. Continued efforts in sensitising customers on the steps to be taken to manage the associated risks will enable a smooth completion of the final leg of the transition.\n\n6. The Reserve Bank will continue to monitor the efforts of banks/FIs for ensuring a smooth transition from LIBOR.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Dimple Bhandia) Chief General Manager",

The current standard assets provisioning norms for UCBs, consolidated in the [Master Circular DOR.STR.REC.5/21.04.048/2022-23](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12283) dated April 01, 2022, are based on the earlier categorization of UCBs into Tier I and Tier II as defined in para 4 of [circular UBD.CO.LS.Cir.No.66/07.01.000/2008-09 dated May 06, 2009,](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4970&Mode=0) as given below:\n\n\n3. On a review, it has been decided to harmonise the provisioning norms for standard assets applicable to all categories of UCBs, irrespective of their Tier in the revised framework.\n\n4. Accordingly, the standard asset provisioning norms applicable to Tier I, Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 UCBs under the revised framework shall be as under:\n\n- a. Direct advances to agriculture and SME sectors which are standard, shall attract a uniform provisioning requirement of 0.25 percent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis.\n- b. Advances to commercial real estate (CRE) sector which are standard shall attract a uniform provisioning requirement of 1.00 percent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis.\n- c. For advances to commercial real estate residential housing (CRE-RH) sector, which are standard, the provisioning requirement shall be 0.75 percent\n- d. For all other advances, banks shall maintain a uniform general standard asset provision of a minimum of 0.40 percent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis.\n\n5. The erstwhile Tier I UCBs, which are currently maintaining standard asset provision of 0.25% on 'all other loans and advances not included above' as specified in table at para 2 above, are permitted to achieve the provisioning requirement of 0.40% on such advances in a staggered manner by March 31, 2025. Thus, provision on all such standard loans and advances outstanding as on March 31, 2023 shall be increased to 0.30% by March 31, 2024, to 0.35% by September 30, 2024 and to 0.40% by March 31, 2025.\n\n6. These guidelines shall come into effect from the date of this circular. All other instructions stipulated in the Master Circular *ibid* remain unchanged.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Manoranjan Mishra) Chief General Manager",

In terms of paragraph 3 (viii) of the circular, the instructions were to come into effect from January 1, 2024. However, considering that certain clarifications and additional time has been sought by some regulated entities (REs) to reconfigure their internal systems and operationalize the circular, it has been decided to extend the timeline for implementation of the instructions by three months. Accordingly, REs shall ensure that the instructions are implemented in respect of all the fresh loans availed from April 1, 2024 onwards. In the case of existing loans, the switchover to new penal charges regime shall be ensured on the next review/ renewal date falling on or after April 1, 2024, but not later than June 30, 2024.\n\n3. A set of [frequently asked questions \\(FAQs\\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQView.aspx?Id=162) providing clarifications related to implementation of the circular will be uploaded in the FAQs section of the RBI website shortly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Santosh Kumar Panigrahy) Chief General Manager\n\nCaution: RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes calls asking for personal information like bank account details, passwords, etc. It never keeps or offers funds to anyone.

NABARD, NHB and SIDBI are considered as National Development Banks (NDBs) under the extant NSFR framework. On a review, it has been decided that the other All India Financial Institutions (AIFIs) i.e. EXIM Bank and National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) shall also be considered as NDBs for NSFR computation.\n\n3. Further, unencumbered loans to NDBs with a residual maturity of one year or more that would qualify for a 35 per cent or lower risk weight under the Standardised Approach for credit risk [1](#page-0-0) shall be assigned a Required Stable Funding (RSF) factor of 65 per cent (as against 100 per cent currently).\n\n4. Accordingly, the select instructions have been amended as detailed in **[Annex](#page-1-0)**.\n\n## **Applicability**\n\n5.
