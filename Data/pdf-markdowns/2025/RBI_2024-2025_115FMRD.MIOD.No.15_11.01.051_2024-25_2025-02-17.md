RBI/2024-25/115 FMRD.MIOD.No.15/11.01.051/2024-25 February 17, 2025

To All participants in Government Securities market

Madam/Sir,

## **Government securities transactions between a Primary Member (PM) of NDS-OM and its own Gilt Account Holder (GAH) or between two GAHs of the same PM**

Transactions in Government securities in the Over the Counter (OTC) market are currently undertaken either on Negotiated Dealing System - Order Matching (NDS-OM) platform or are bilaterally negotiated outside the system and subsequently reported on NDS-OM. All transactions matched on NDS-OM platform are cleared and settled through the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL), which acts as a Central Counter Party (CCP) for transactions in Government securities.

2. At present, transactions between a Primary Member (PM) and its own Gilt Account Holder (GAH) and between two GAHs of the same PM are not permitted to be matched on NDS-OM and are also not cleared and settled through CCIL. On a review and based on the feedback received, it has been decided to:

- a. Permit matching of transactions between a PM and its own GAH or between two GAHs of the same PM on both the anonymous Order Matching segment and the Request for Quote (RFQ) segment of NDS-OM. Transactions matched on NDS-OM shall be cleared and settled through CCIL.
- b. Extend the facility of clearing and settlement through CCIL to transactions between a PM and its own GAH or between two GAHs of the same PM which are bilaterally negotiated and reported to NDS-OM, on an optional basis.
