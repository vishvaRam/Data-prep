# **Master Circular**

#### **Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy – Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)**

#### <span id="page-2-0"></span>**1. Introduction**

Capital acts as a buffer in times of crisis or poor performance by a bank. Sufficiency of capital also instills depositors' confidence. As such, adequacy of capital is one of the preconditions for licensing of a new bank as well as its continuance in business.

### <span id="page-2-1"></span>**2. Statutory Requirements**

In terms of the provisions contained in Section 11 of Banking Regulation Act (AACS), no co-operative bank shall commence or carry on banking business unless the aggregate value of its paid-up capital and reserves is not less than one lakh of rupees. In addition, under Section 22(3)(d) of the above Act, the Reserve Bank prescribes the minimum entry point capital (entry point norms) from time to time, for setting-up of a new Primary (Urban) Cooperative Bank.

### <span id="page-2-2"></span>**3. Net Worth**

UCBs shall have minimum net worth as under:

- Tier 1[1](#page-2-4) UCBs operating in a single district shall have minimum net worth of ₹2 crore.
- All other UCBs (of all tiers) shall have minimum net worth of ₹5 crore.
- UCBs which currently do not meet the minimum net worth requirement, as above, shall achieve the minimum net worth of ₹2 crore or ₹5 crore (as applicable) in a phased manner. Such UCBs shall achieve at least 50 per cent of the applicable minimum net worth on or before March 31, 2026 and the entire stipulated minimum net worth on or before March 31, 2028.

The computation of "Net worth" in this context is provided in [Annex](#page-10-0) 1.

## <span id="page-2-3"></span>**4. Capital Adequacy Norms**

UCBs shall maintain minimum Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) as under:

- Tier 1 UCBs shall maintain, as hitherto, a minimum CRAR of 9 per cent of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) on an ongoing basis.
- Tier 2 to 4 UCBs shall maintain a minimum CRAR of 12 per cent of RWAs on an ongoing basis.

<span id="page-2-4"></span> <sup>1</sup> Tier 1 - All unit UCBs and salary earners' UCBs (irrespective of deposit size), and all other UCBs having deposits up to ₹100 crore;

Tier 2 - UCBs with deposits more than ₹100 crore and up to ₹1000 crore;

Tier 3 - UCBs with deposits more than ₹1000 crore and up to ₹10,000 crore;

Tier 4 - UCBs with deposits more than ₹10,000 crore

• UCBs in Tier 2 to 4, which do not currently meet the revised CRAR of 12 per cent of RWAs, shall achieve the same in a phased manner. Such UCBs shall achieve the CRAR of at least 10 per cent by March 31, 2024, 11 per cent by March 31, 2025, and 12 per cent by March 31, 2026.

The computation of CRAR will be as under:

 CRAR = Eligible Total Capital Total Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs)

The capital funds (eligible total capital) for capital adequacy purposes shall consist of Tier I and Tier II capital as defined below. The total of Tier II capital shall be limited to a maximum of 100 per cent of total Tier I capital for the purpose of compliance with CRAR norms.

Risk weights for different categories of exposures of banks are outlined in [Annex](#page-12-0) 2.

## **4.1 Tier I Capital**

Tier I shall comprise the following:

- (i) Paid-up share capital[2](#page-3-0) collected from regular members having voting rights.
- (ii) Contributions received from associate / nominal members where the byelaws permit allotment of shares to them and provided there are restrictions on withdrawal of such shares, as applicable to regular members.
- (iii) Contribution / non-refundable admission fees collected from the nominal and associate members which is held separately as 'reserves' under an appropriate head since these are not refundable.
- (iv) Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) which comply with the regulatory requirements as specified in [Annex](#page-19-0) 3.
- (v) Free Reserves as per the audited accounts. Reserves, if any, created to meet outside liabilities should not be included in the Tier I Capital. Free reserves shall exclude all reserves / provisions which are created to meet anticipated loan losses, losses on account of fraud etc., depreciation in investments and other assets and other outside liabilities. For example, the amount held under the head "Building Fund" will be treated as part of free reserve[3](#page-3-1). Similarly, "Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve" complying with all the terms and instructions issued vide [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12716&Mode=0)

<span id="page-3-0"></span> <sup>2</sup> UCBs are permitted to raise share capital, as hitherto, by way of (i) issue of shares to persons within their area of operation, in accordance with the provisions of their bye-laws, and (ii) issue of additional shares to the existing members.

<span id="page-3-1"></span><sup>3</sup> In terms of [circular DOR.CAP.REC.No.30/09.18.201/2024-25 dated July 30, 2024,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12714&Mode=0) as a one-time measure, balances in Dividend Equalisation Fund (DEF) could be transferred to general reserves/free reserves and treated as Tier I Capital.

[DOR.CAP.REC.No.27/09.18.201/2024-25 dated August 02, 2024,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12716&Mode=0) shall also be treated as free reserves.

- (vi) Capital Reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds of assets.
- (vii) Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDIs) which comply with the regulatory requirements as specified in [Annex 4.](#page-25-0)
- (viii) Any surplus (net) in Profit and Loss Account i.e., balance after appropriation towards dividend payable, education fund, other funds whose utilisation is defined, asset loss, if any, etc.
- (ix) Outstanding amount in Special Reserve created under Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
- (x) Revaluation reserves, arising out of change in the carrying amount of a bank's property consequent upon its revaluation, may be reckoned as Tier I capital at a discount of 55 per cent, subject to meeting the following conditions:
	- the bank is able to sell the property readily at its own will and there is no legal impediment in selling the property;
	- the revaluation reserves are presented/disclosed separately under "Reserve Fund and Other Reserves" in the Balance Sheet;
	- revaluations are realistic, in accordance with applicable accounting standards;
	- valuations are obtained, from two independent valuers, at least once in every three years;
	- where the value of the property has been substantially impaired by any event, these are to be immediately revalued and appropriately factored into capital adequacy computations;
	- the external auditor(s) of the bank have not expressed a qualified opinion on the revaluation of the property;
	- the instructions on valuation of properties and other specific requirements as mentioned in Annex 1 (Guidelines on Valuation of Properties – Empanelment of Valuers) to the [Master Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12525)  [DOR.CRE.REC.No.27/07.10.002/2023-24 dated July 25, 2023](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12525) on Management of Advances – UCBs, as amended from time to time, are strictly adhered to.

Revaluation reserves which do not qualify as Tier I capital shall also not qualify as Tier II capital. The bank may choose to reckon revaluation reserves in Tier I capital or Tier II capital at its discretion, subject to fulfilment of all the conditions specified above.

#### *Note :*

- *(i) Amount of intangible assets, losses in current year and those brought forward from previous periods, deficit in NPA provisions, income wrongly recognized on non-performing assets, provision required for liability devolved on bank, etc. will be deducted from Tier I Capital.*
- *(ii) For a Fund to be included in the Tier I Capital, the Fund should satisfy two criteria viz., the Fund should be created as an appropriation of net profit and should be a free reserve and not a specific reserve. However, if the same has been created not by appropriation of profit but by a charge on the profit then this Fund is in effect a provision and hence will be eligible for being reckoned only as Tier II capital as defined below and subject to a limit of 1.25% of risk weight assets provided it is not attributed to any identified potential loss or diminution in value of an asset or a known liability.*
- *(iii) Outstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) which were issued in terms of Annex to [circular UCB.PCB.Cir.No.39/09.16.900/08-09 dated January](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4782&Mode=0)  23, [2009](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4782&Mode=0) shall also be eligible to be reckoned as Tier I capital subject to the ceilings prescribed in Annexes to this Master Circular. It may be noted that the Annex to circular dated January 23, 2009 has since been repealed vide [circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12251&Mode=0)  [No. DOR.CAP.REC.92/09.18.201/2021-22 dated March 08, 2022,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12251&Mode=0) and with effect from March 08, 2022, amount issued through PDI by conversion of existing deposits as part of revival plan/ financial reconstruction of the UCBs (in terms of circular dated January 23, 2009) shall comply with the [Annex 4](#page-25-0) of this Master Circular.*

### **4.2 Tier II Capital**

Tier II capital shall comprise the following:

### **4.2.1 General Provisions and Loss Reserves**

These would include such provisions of general nature appearing in the books of the bank which are not attributed to any identified potential loss or a diminution in value of an asset or a known liability. Adequate care must be taken to ensure that sufficient provisions have been made to meet all known losses and foreseeable potential losses before considering any amount of general provision as part of Tier II capital as indicated above. To illustrate: General provision for Standard Assets, excess provision on transfer of stressed loans etc. could be considered for inclusion under this category. Such provisions which are considered for inclusion in Tier II capital will be admitted up to 1.25% of total risk weighted assets.

As per the extant instructions, provisions made for NPAs as per prudential norms are deducted from the amount of Gross NPAs to arrive at the amount of Net NPAs. The prudential treatment of different type of provisions and its treatment for capital adequacy purposes is given below:

#### (a) Additional General Provisions (Floating Provisions)

Additional general provisions (floating provisions) for bad debts i.e., provisions not earmarked for any specific loan impairments (NPAs) may be used either for netting off of gross NPAs or for inclusion in Tier II capital within the overall ceiling of 1.25% of total risk weighted assets but cannot be used on both counts.

#### (b) Additional Provisions for NPAs at higher than prescribed rates

In cases where banks make specific provision for NPAs in excess of what is prescribed under the prudential norms, the total specific provision may be deducted from the amount of Gross NPAs while reporting the amount of Net NPAs. The additional specific provision made by the bank will not be reckoned as Tier II capital.

(c) Excess Provisions on transfer of stressed loans to Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARC)

In terms of instructions issued vid[e Reserve Bank of India \(Transfer of Loan](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12166)  [Exposures\) Directions, 2021 dated September 24, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12166) and as amended from time to time, excess provisions on transfer of stressed loans to ARC, until reversal, shall continue to be shown under 'provisions' and would be considered as Tier II capital within the overall ceiling of 1.25% of risk weighed assets.

#### (d) Provisions for Diminution in Fair Value

Provisions for diminution in the fair value of restructured accounts, both in respect of standard assets and NPAs, are permitted to be netted from the relative loan asset and will not be reckoned as Tier II capital.

#### **4.2.2 Investment Fluctuation Reserve**

Balances in the Investment Fluctuation Reserve, created in terms of [Master](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  Direction – [Reserve Bank of India \(Classification, Valuation and Operation](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [of Investment Portfolio of Primary \(Urban\) Co-operative Banks\) Directions,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [2023 dated April 1, 2023,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) shall be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital.

#### **4.2.3 Tier II capital instruments**

UCBs may issue the following instruments to augment their Tier II capital:

a) Upper Tier II instruments - Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS), Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS) and Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS) which comply with the regulatory requirements as specified in [Annex](#page-19-0) 3.

b) Lower Tier II instruments - Long Term Subordinated Bonds (LTSB) which comply with the regulatory requirements as specified in [Annex 4.](#page-25-0)

*Note: Outstanding Long Term (Subordinated) Deposits (LTD) which were issued in terms of Annex-II to the [circular UBD.PCB.Cir.No.4 /09.18.201/08-09 dated July](https://rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4370&Mode=0)  [15, 2008,](https://rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4370&Mode=0) and subsequent amendments thereto, shall also be eligible to be reckoned as Tier II capital subject to the ceilings prescribed in [Annex 4](#page-25-0) to this Master Circular. It may be noted that the circular dated July 15, 2008 has since been repealed vide [circular No. DOR.CAP.REC.92/09.18.201/2021-22 dated](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12251&Mode=0)  [March 08, 2022.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12251&Mode=0)*

### <span id="page-7-0"></span>**5. Capital for Market Risk**

5.1 Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and offbalance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions, which are subject to capital charge are as under:

- The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the trading book; and
- Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the bank (both banking and trading books).

5.2 As an initial step towards prescribing capital requirement for market risks, UCBs were advised to assign an additional risk weight of 2.5 per cent on investments. These additional risk weights are clubbed with the risk weights prescribed for credit risk in respect of investment portfolio of UCBs as per [Annex](#page-12-0) 2, and banks are not required to provide for the same separately. Further, UCBs are advised to assign a risk weight of 100% on the open position limits on foreign exchange and gold, and to build up investment fluctuation reserve as per extant instructions.

5.3 UCBs having AD Category I licence are required to provide capital for market risk in terms of [circular UBD.BPD\(PCB\)Cir.No.42/09.11.600/2009-10 dated](https://rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5495&Mode=0) [February](https://rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5495&Mode=0) 8, 2010.

#### <span id="page-7-1"></span>**6. Share linking to Borrowings**

Borrowings from UCBs (except in the case of advances against fixed deposits) shall be linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members as below:

- (i) 5 per cent of the borrowings, if the borrowings are on unsecured basis.
- (ii) 2.5 per cent of the borrowings, in case of secured borrowings.
- (iii) In case of secured borrowings by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs), 2.5 per cent of the borrowings, of which 1 per cent is to be collected initially and the balance of 1.5 per cent is to be collected in the course of next 2 years.

The above share linking norms may be applicable for member's shareholdings up to

the limit of 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank. Where a member is already holding 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of a UCB, it would not be necessary for him / her to subscribe to any additional share capital on account of the application of extant share linking norms. In other words, a borrowing member may be required to hold shares for an amount that may be computed as per the extant share linking norms or for an amount that is 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank, whichever is lower.

Share-linking to borrowing norms shall be discretionary for UCBs which meet the minimum regulatory CRAR applicable and a Tier 1 CRAR of 5.5 per cent as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection. Such UCBs shall have a Board-approved policy on sharelinking to borrowing norms which shall be implemented in a transparent, consistent and non-discriminatory manner. The policy may be reviewed by the Board at the beginning of the accounting year. UCBs, which do not maintain the minimum CRAR applicable and Tier I CRAR of 5.5 per cent, shall continue to be guided by the norms on share-linking to borrowing as specified above.

Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) held by members / subscribers, may be treated as shares for the purpose of compliance with the extant share linking to borrowing norms.

## <span id="page-8-0"></span>**7. Refund of share capital**

In terms of Section 12 (2) (ii) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, a co-operative bank shall not withdraw or reduce its share capital, except to the extent and subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf. Accordingly, it has been decided to permit UCBs to refund the share capital to their members, or nominees / heirs of deceased members, on demand[4](#page-8-2), subject to the following conditions:

a) The bank complies with the minimum applicable regulatory CRAR, both as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection.

b) Such refund does not result in the CRAR of the bank falling below the minimum regulatory CRAR applicable to the bank.

For the purpose of computing CRAR as above, accretion to capital funds after the balance sheet date[5](#page-8-3), other than by way of profits, may be taken into account. Any reduction in capital funds, including by way of losses, during the aforesaid period shall also be considered.

#### <span id="page-8-1"></span>**8. Measures for protection of investors in regulatory capital instruments specified in [Annex 3](#page-19-0) and [Annex 4](#page-25-0)**

For the purpose of enhancing investor education on the risk characteristics of regulatory capital instruments, UCBs, which issue regulatory capital instruments

 <sup>4</sup> Subject to the member fulfilling all the eligibility conditions for refund.

<span id="page-8-3"></span><span id="page-8-2"></span><sup>5</sup> Capital funds shall be as per audited data.

specified in [Annex](#page-19-0) 3 and [Annex](#page-25-0) 4 shall adhere to the following conditions:

a) For floating rate instruments, banks should not use its Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark.

b) A specific sign-off, as quoted below, from the investors, for having understood the features and risks of the instruments, may be incorporated in the common application form of the proposed issue:

"By making this application, I / we acknowledge that I / we have understood the terms and conditions of the issue of [Name of the share/security] being issued by [Name of the bank] as disclosed in the Prospectus and Offer Document".

c) UCBs shall ensure that all the publicity material / offer document, application form and other communication with the investor should clearly state in bold letters (Arial font, size 14, equivalent size in English / Vernacular version) how a PNCPS / PCPS / RNCPS / RCPS / PDI / LTSB, as the case may be, is different from a fixed deposit, and that these instruments are not covered by deposit insurance.

d) The procedure for transfer to legal heirs in the event of death of the subscriber of the instrument should also be specified.

#### <span id="page-9-0"></span>**9. Returns**

Banks should furnish to the respective Regional Offices annual return indicating (i) capital funds, (ii) conversion of off-balance sheet / non-funded exposures, (iii) calculation of risk weighted assets, and (iv) calculation of capital funds and risk assets ratio. The format of the return is given in the [Annex](#page-31-0) 5. The returns should be signed by two officials who are authorized to sign the statutory returns submitted to Reserve Bank.

### **I. B. Off-Balance Sheet Items**

The credit risk exposure attached to off-Balance Sheet items has to be first calculated by multiplying the face amount of each of the off-Balance Sheet items by 'credit conversion factors' as indicated in the table below. This will then have to be again multiplied by the weights attributable to the relevant counter-party as specified above.

*Note: At present, Primary Urban Cooperative Banks may not be undertaking most of the off balance sheet transactions. However, keeping in view their potential for expansion, riskweights are indicated against various off balance sheet items, which, Primary Urban Cooperative Banks may undertake in future.*

**II. Additional Risk Weights** (applicable to Authorised Dealers only)

#### 1. **Foreign Exchange and Interest Rate related Contracts**

- 1.1 Foreign exchange contracts include the following:
	- (a) Cross currency swaps
	- (b) Forward foreign exchange contracts
	- (c) Currency futures
	- (d) Currency options purchased
	- (e) Other contracts of a similar nature
- 1.2 Interest rate contracts include the following:
	- (a) Single currency interest rate swaps
	- (b) Basis swaps
	- (c) Forward rate agreements
	- (d) Interest rate futures
	- (e) Interest rate options purchased
	- (f) Other contracts of a similar nature
- 1.3 As in the case of other off-Balance Sheet items, a two-stage calculation prescribed below shall be applied:

| (a) Step 1 - |  |  |                                       |  | The notional principal amount of each instrument is |  |
|--------------|--|--|---------------------------------------|--|-----------------------------------------------------|--|
| multiplied   |  |  | by the conversion factor given below: |  |                                                     |  |

| Original maturity                   | Conversion factor          |                               |  |  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--|--|
|                                     | Interest rate<br>contracts | Foreign Exchange<br>Contracts |  |  |
| Less than one year                  | 0.5%                       | 2%                            |  |  |
| One year and less<br>than two years | 1.0%                       | 5% (i.e.,<br>2% + 3%)         |  |  |
| For each additional<br>year         | 1.0%                       | 3%                            |  |  |

When effective bilateral netting contracts as specified in paragraph II.3 of this Annex are in place, the conversion factors, as mentioned in the below table, shall be applicable[7](#page-17-0) :

| Original maturity         | Conversion factor |              |  |
|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|--|
|                           | Interest          | Foreign      |  |
|                           | rate              | Exchange     |  |
|                           | contracts         | Contracts    |  |
| Less than one year        | 0.35%             | 1.5%         |  |
| One year and less         | 0.75%             | 3.75% (i.e., |  |
| than two years            |                   | 1.5% +       |  |
|                           |                   | 2.25%)       |  |
| For<br>each<br>additional | 0.75%             | 2.25%        |  |
| year                      |                   |              |  |

(b) Step 2 - The adjusted value thus obtained shall be multiplied by the risk weight allotted to the relevant counter-party as given in I-A above.

*Note: At present, most of the Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks are not carrying out forex transactions. However, those who have been given A.D's licence may undertake transactions mentioned above. In the event of any uncertainty in assigning risk weight against a specific transaction, RBI clarification may be sought for.*

#### 2**. Repo in Corporate Bonds**

UCBs which are lenders of funds in the repo transaction are required to provide counter-party credit risk corresponding to the risk weight for such exposure as applicable to the loan / investment exposure.

<span id="page-17-0"></span> <sup>7</sup> For purposes of calculating the credit exposure to a netting counterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which notional principal is equivalent to cash flows, the original credit conversion factors (i.e., without considering the impact of bilateral netting) should be applied to the notional principal, which is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. In no case should the reduced factors above be applied to net notional amounts.

## 3. **Requirement for recognition of Bilateral Netting Contract:**

(a) UCBs may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between a UCB and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations.

(b) UCBs may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting not covered in (a), including other forms of novation.

(c) In both cases (a) and (b), a UCB will need to satisfy that it has:

(i) A netting contract or agreement with the counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that the UCB would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances.

(ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find the UCB's exposure to be such a net amount under:

- The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located.
- The law that governs the individual transactions; and
- The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting.

(iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.

(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose of calculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A walkaway clause is a provision which permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make only limited payments or no payment at all, to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor.

# **Guidelines on Issuance of Preference Shares**

### <span id="page-19-0"></span>**A. Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) eligible for inclusion in Tier I capital**

UCBs are permitted to issue Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) at face value to their members or any other person residing within their area of operation, with the prior approval of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The UCBs shall submit the application seeking permission, together with the Prospectus / Offer Document / Information Memorandum, to the concerned Regional Office (RO) of the RBI. A certificate from a Chartered Accountant to the effect that the terms of the offer document are in compliance with these instructions shall also be submitted along with the application. The amounts raised through PNCPS shall comply with the following terms and conditions to qualify for inclusion as Tier I capital.

## **2. Terms of Issue**

### **2.1 Limits**

The outstanding amount of PNCPS and Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) along with outstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI) shall not exceed 35 per cent of total Tier I capital at any point of time. The above limit will be based on the amount of Tier I capital after deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets, but before deduction of equity investment in subsidiaries, if any. PNCPS issued in excess of the overall ceiling of 35 per cent, shall be eligible for inclusion under Upper Tier II capital, subject to limits prescribed for Tier II capital. However, investors' rights and obligations would remain unchanged.

## **2.2 Amount**

The amount of PNCPS to be raised shall be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.

### **2.3 Maturity**

The PNCPS shall be perpetual.

# **2.4 Options**

- a. PNCPS shall not be issued with a 'put option' or 'step up option'.
- b. PNCPS may be issued with a call option, subject to following conditions:
	- i. The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at least ten years; and
	- ii. Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of Department of Regulation (DoR), RBI. While considering the proposals received from banks for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank's CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option.

## **2.5 Classification in the Balance Sheet**

These instruments shall be classified as 'Capital' and shown separately in the Balance Sheet.

## **2.6 Dividend**

The rate of dividend payable to the investors will be a fixed rate or a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.

## **2.7 Payment of Dividend**

2.7.1 The payment of dividend by the bank shall be subject to availability of distributable surplus out of current year's profits, and if:

- i. the CRAR is above the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI
- ii. the impact of such payment does not result in bank's CRAR falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI
- iii. the balance sheet as at the end of the previous year does not show any accumulated loss

2.7.2 The dividend shall not be cumulative, i.e., dividend missed in a year shall not be paid in subsequent years even if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to the regulatory minimum. When dividend is paid at a rate lesser than the prescribed rate, the unpaid amount will not be paid in future years, even if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to the regulatory minimum.

2.7.3 All instances of non-payment of dividend / payment of dividend at a rate less than that specified should be reported by the issuing UCB to the concerned RO of Department of Supervision (DoS), RBI.

## **2.8 Seniority of Claim**

The claims of the investors in PNCPS shall be senior to the claims of investors in equity shares and subordinated to the claims of all other creditors and the depositors.

## **2.9 Voting Rights**

The investors in PNCPS shall not be eligible for any voting rights.

## **2.10 Discount**

The PNCPS shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes since these are perpetual.

### **2.11 Other Conditions**

2.11.1 PNCPS shall be fully paid-up, unsecured, and free of any restrictive clauses.

2.11.2 UCBs shall also comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the PNCPS, provided they are not in conflict with the terms and conditions specified in these guidelines. Any instance of conflict shall be brought to the notice of DoR of RBI for seeking confirmation of the eligibility of the instrument for inclusion in Tier I capital.

# **2.12 Compliance with Reserve Requirements**

2.12.1 The total amount raised by the bank by issue of PNCPS shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements.

2.12.2 However, the amount collected from members / prospective investors and held pending allotment of the PNCPS, shall be reckoned as liability for the purpose of calculating the net demand and time liabilities and shall, accordingly, attract reserve requirements. Such amounts shall not be reckoned for calculation of capital funds.

## **2.13 Reporting Requirements**

UCBs issuing PNCPS shall submit a report to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI, giving details of the capital raised, including the terms and conditions of issue together with a copy of the Prospectus / Offer Document, soon after the issue is completed.

## **2.14 Investments in PNCPS and Advances for Purchase of PNCPS**

UCBs shall not grant any loan or advance to any person for purchasing their own PNCPS or the PNCPS of other banks. Further, UCBs shall not invest in PNCPS of other banks and shall not grant advances against the security of the PNCPS issued by them or other banks.

#### **B. Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS) / Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS) / Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS) for inclusion in Upper Tier II capital**

UCBs are permitted to issue Perpetual Cumulative Preference Shares (PCPS) / Redeemable Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (RNCPS) / Redeemable Cumulative Preference Shares (RCPS), at face value, to their members or any other person residing within their area of operation, with the prior approval of the RBI.

A certificate from a Chartered Accountant to the effect that the terms of the offer document are in compliance with these instructions shall also be submitted along with the application. These three instruments, collectively referred to as Tier II preference shares, shall comply with the following terms and conditions, to qualify for inclusion as Upper Tier II capital.

## **2. Terms of issue**

## **2.1 Limits**

The outstanding amount of these instruments along with other components of Tier II capital shall not exceed 100 per cent of Tier I capital at any point of time. The above limit shall be based on the amount of Tier I capital after deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets, but before deduction of equity investment in subsidiaries, if any.

## **2.2 Amount**

The amount to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.

## **2.3 Maturity**

The Tier II preference shares could be either perpetual (PCPS) or dated (RNCPS and RCPS) instruments with a minimum maturity of 10 years.

While considering the proposals received from banks for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank's CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option.

### **2.5 Classification in the Balance Sheet**

These instruments will be classified as 'Borrowings' and shown separately in the Balance sheet.

### **2.6 Coupon**

The coupon payable to the investors may be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.

### **2.7 Payment of Coupon**

2.7.1 The coupon payable on these instruments will be treated as interest and accordingly debited to P& L Account. However, it will be payable only if:

- a) the bank's CRAR is above the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI
- b) the impact of such payment does not result in bank's CRAR falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement.
- c) the bank should not have a net loss. For this purpose, the net loss is defined as either (i) the accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year or (ii) the loss incurred during the current financial year.

2.7.2 In the case of PCPS and RCPS, the unpaid / partly unpaid coupon will be treated as a liability. The interest amount due and remaining unpaid may be allowed to be paid in later years subject to the bank complying with the above requirements.

2.7.3 In the case of RNCPS, deferred coupon will not be paid in future years, even if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to the regulatory minimum. The bank can however pay a coupon at a rate lesser than the specified rate, if adequate profit is available and the level of CRAR conforms to the regulatory minimum, subject to conformity with para 2.7.1.

2.7.4 All instances of non-payment of interest or payment of interest at a rate lesser than the specified rate should be reported by the issuing UCB to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI.

- (b) the impact of such payment does not result in bank's CRAR falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement.

## **2.9 Seniority of Claim**

The claims of the investors in these instruments shall be senior to the claims of investors in instruments eligible for inclusion in Tier I capital and subordinate to the claims of all other creditors including those in lower Tier II capital and the depositors. Amongst the investors of various instruments included in Upper Tier II capital, the claims shall rank *pari passu* with each other.

## **2.10 Voting Rights**

The investors in Tier II preference shares shall not be eligible for any voting rights.

A certificate from a Chartered Accountant to the effect that the terms of the offer document are in compliance with these instructions shall also be submitted along with the application.

PDI in excess of the above limits shall be eligible for inclusion under Tier II capital, subject to the limits prescribed for Tier II capital. However, investors' rights and obligations would remain unchanged.

<span id="page-25-2"></span><sup>9</sup> Issued in terms of circular [UCB.PCB.Cir.No.39/09.16.900/08-09](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4782&Mode=0) dated January 23, 2009 on Financial Restructuring of UCBs.

# **2.4 Options**

- 2.4.1 The PDI shall not be issued with a 'put option' or 'step-up' option.
- 2.4.2 However, PDI may be issued with a call option subject to following conditions:
	- a) The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at least ten years; and
	- b) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of Department of Regulation (DoR), RBI. While considering the proposals received from banks for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank's CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option.

## **2.5 Classification**

PDI shall be classified as 'Borrowings' and shown separately in the Balance Sheet.

### **2.6 Rate of interest**

The interest payable to the investors may be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.

## **2.7 Lock-in-Clause**

2.7.1 PDI shall be subjected to a lock-in-clause in terms of which the issuing bank shall not be liable to pay interest, if

- i. the bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI; or
- ii. the impact of such payment results in bank's CRAR falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI;

2.7.2 However, UCBs may pay interest with the prior approval of the DoR, RBI when the impact of such payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR meets the regulatory norm. For this purpose, net loss is defined as either (i) the accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year or (ii) the loss incurred during the current financial year.

2.7.3 The interest shall not be cumulative.

2.7.4 All instances of invocation of the lock-in-clause should be reported by the issuing UCB to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI.

## **2.8 Seniority of claim**

The claims of the investors of PDI shall be superior to the claims of investors in equity shares and PNCPS but subordinated to the claims of all other creditors and the depositors. Among investors in PDI and outstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI[10](#page-27-0)), the claims shall rank *pari passu* with each other.

## **2.9 Discount**

The PDI shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes since these are perpetual.

## **2.10 Other conditions**

2.10.1 PDI shall be fully paid-up, unsecured and free of any restrictive clauses.

2.10.2 UCBs shall also comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the PDI, provided they are not in conflict with the terms and conditions specified in these guidelines. Any instance of conflict shall be brought to the notice of the DoR of RBI for seeking confirmation of the eligibility of the instrument for inclusion in Tier I capital.

# **2.11 Compliance with Reserve Requirements**

The total amount raised by a UCB through the issue of PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements. However, the amount collected from members / prospective investors and pending issue of PDI, shall be reckoned as liability for the purpose of calculating the net demand and time liabilities and shall, accordingly, attract reserve requirements. Such amounts pending issue of PDI, shall not be reckoned for calculation of capital funds.

## **2.12 Reporting Requirements**

UCBs issuing PDI shall submit a report to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI giving details of the amount raised, including the terms and conditions of issue together with a copy of the Prospectus / Offer Document, soon after the issue is completed.

## **2.13 Investments in PDI and Advances for Purchase of PDI**

UCBs shall not grant any loan or advance to any person for purchasing their PDI or PDI of other banks. UCBs shall not invest in PDI issued by other banks (except when the PDI are issued as a part of revival plan of a UCB as mentioned in Para 1 above) and shall not grant advances against the security of PDI issued by them or other banks.

# **B. Long Term Subordinated Bonds (LTSB) eligible for inclusion in Lower Tier II capital**

UCBs are permitted to issue LTSB to their members, or any other person residing within their area of operation. The amounts raised through LTSB shall comply with the following terms and conditions to be eligible for inclusion in Lower Tier II capital.

These instruments, together with other components of Tier II capital shall not exceed 100 per cent of Tier I capital. The aforementioned limit shall be based on the amount of Tier I capital after deduction of goodwill and other intangible assets, but before the deduction of equity investments in subsidiaries, if any.

## **2.3 Amount**

The amount to be raised may be decided by the Board of Directors of banks.

# **2.4 Maturity**

LTSB shall be issued with a minimum maturity of ten years.

# **2.5 Options**

## **2.8 Redemption / Repayment**

Redemption / repayment at maturity shall be made only with the prior approval of the DoR, RBI.

## **2.9 Seniority of Claims**

LTSB will be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other creditors but would rank senior to the claims of investors in instruments eligible for inclusion in Tier I capital and holders of preference shares (both Tier I & Tier II). Among investors of instruments included in Lower Tier II capital (i.e., including outstanding LTDs, if any), the claims shall rank *pari passu* with each other.

## **2.10 Progressive Discount**

These Bonds shall be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes in the last five years of their tenor, as under:

| Remaining Maturity of<br>Instruments          | Rate of Discount (%) |

Any instance of conflict shall be brought to the notice of the DoR of RBI for seeking confirmation of the eligibility of the instrument for inclusion in Tier II capital.

### **2.12 Reserve Requirement**

The total amount raised through the issue of LTSB shall be reckoned as liability for the calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will attract CRR / SLR requirements. The amount collected by the UCB from members / prospective investors and held by it pending issue of LTSB, shall not be reckoned for calculation of capital funds.

### **2.13 Reporting Requirements**

UCBs issuing LTSB shall submit a report to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI giving details of the amount raised, including the terms and conditions of issue together with a copy of Prospectus / Offer Document, soon after the issue is completed.
