Madam / Dear Sir

## **Currency Chest operations on March 31, 2025**

In terms of instructions contained in [circular DOR.CO.SOG\(Leg\)No.59/09.08.02](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12778&Mode=0)  [4/2024-25 dated February 11, 2025,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12778&Mode=0) all branches of the banks dealing with Government receipts and payments are to be kept open for transactions on March 31, 2025 (Monday-Public Holiday), so as to account for the Government transactions in FY 2024-25 itself. Since such transactions might necessitate operations at CCs, the banks are advised to keep their CCs open on March 31, 2025, akin to a normal working day.

2. The CC holding banks shall keep the linked branches suitably informed.

Yours faithfully,

(Sanjeev Prakash) Chief General Manager-in-Charge
