#### **Chapter I: Preliminary**

#### <span id="page-2-1"></span><span id="page-2-0"></span>1. **Preamble**

Reserve Bank is statutorily mandated to operate the credit system of the country to its advantage. In this endeavour, Reserve Bank encourages innovation in the financial systems, products and credit delivery methods while ensuring orderly growth, financial stability and protection of depositors' and borrowers' interest. Certain concerns had emerged around the methods of designing, delivering and servicing digital credit products, which if not mitigated, may impact the borrower's confidence in the digital lending ecosystem. The concerns primarily relate to unbridled engagement of third parties, mis-selling, breach of data privacy, unfair business conduct, charging of exorbitant interest rates, and unethical recovery practices. To address these concerns, pursuant to the recommendations made by the "Working Group on Digital Lending", the Reserve Bank has, from time to time, issued guidelines to its regulated entities on digital lending. These Directions consolidate the earlier instructions along with certain new measures for arrangements involving Lending Service Providers partnering with multiple regulated entities as mentioned under para 6, and for creation of a directory of digital lending apps as mentioned under para 17 of these Directions.

Accordingly, in exercise of powers conferred by sections 21, 35A and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, sections 30A and 32 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, section 6 of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and section 11 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, the Reserve Bank of India being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest to do so, hereby issues these Directions hereinafter specified.

#### <span id="page-2-2"></span>2. **Short title and commencement**

i. These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Digital Lending) Directions, 2025.

ii. These Directions shall come into force immediately except for para 6, which shall come into effect from November 1, 2025, and para 17, which shall come into effect from June 15, 2025.

# <span id="page-3-0"></span>3. **Applicability**

- ii. **Default Loss Guarantee (DLG)**: A contractual arrangement, called by whatever name, between the RE and another entity, under which the latter guarantees to compensate the RE, for the loss due to default up to a certain percentage of the loan portfolio of the RE, specified upfront. Any other implicit guarantee of similar nature, linked to the performance of the loan portfolio of the RE and specified upfront, shall also be covered under the definition of DLG.
- iii. **Digital Lending**: A remote and automated lending process, largely by use of seamless digital technologies for customer acquisition, credit assessment, loan approval, disbursement, recovery, and associated customer service.
- iv. **Digital Lending Apps/ Platforms (DLAs)**: Mobile and/or web-based applications, on a standalone basis or as a part of suite of functions of an application with user interface that facilitate digital lending services. DLAs shall include applications of the RE as well as those operated by Lending Service Provider (LSP) engaged by RE for extending any credit facilitation services in conformity with extant outsourcing guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank.
- v. **Lending Service Provider (LSP)**: An agent of a RE (including another RE) who carries out one or more of RE's digital lending functions, or part thereof, in customer acquisition, services incidental to underwriting and pricing, servicing, monitoring, recovery of specific loan or loan portfolio on behalf of RE in conformity with extant outsourcing guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank. [1](#page-4-2)

#### **Chapter II: General Requirements for RE-LSP Arrangements**

# <span id="page-4-1"></span><span id="page-4-0"></span>5. **Due diligence requirements with respect to LSPs**

- i. Digital lending by a RE involving a LSP, shall be carried out under a contractual agreement between the RE and the LSP, which clearly defines the respective roles, rights, and obligations of each party thereto.
- ii. RE shall conduct enhanced due diligence before they enter into an agreement with a LSP for digital lending, taking into account LSP's technical capabilities, robustness of data privacy policies and storage systems, fairness in conduct with borrowers, past records of conduct and ability to comply with all applicable regulations and statutes.

<span id="page-4-2"></span><sup>1</sup> While entities offering only Payment Aggregator (PA) services in terms of the extant instructions issued by RBI shall remain out of the ambit of these Directions, any PA also performing the role of an LSP shall comply with these Directions.

- iii. RE shall carry out periodic review of the conduct of the LSP vis-à-vis the terms of the contractual agreement and shall take appropriate action in the event of any deviation therefrom.

- vii. As an overarching principle, any outsourcing agreement entered into by the RE with an LSP shall in no manner dilute or absolve the RE of its obligations under any statutory or regulatory provision, and the RE shall remain fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of the LSP.

#### <span id="page-5-0"></span>6. **RE-LSP arrangements involving multiple lenders**

In cases where a LSP has agreements with multiple REs for digital lending, each RE shall ensure the following:

# **Chapter III: Conduct and Customer Protection Requirements**

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span><span id="page-6-0"></span>7. **Assessing the borrower's creditworthiness**

- i. RE shall obtain the necessary information relating to economic profile of the borrower with a view to assessing the borrower's creditworthiness before extending any loan, including, at a minimum, age, occupation and income details. The same shall be kept on record for audit purposes.
- ii. RE shall ensure that there is no automatic increase in credit limit unless an explicit request is received, evaluated and kept on record from the borrower for such increase.

<span id="page-6-2"></span><sup>4</sup> As defined under section 2(e) of the 'Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023' dated November 30, 2023, issued by Central Consumer Protection Authority, as amended from time to time.

- iv. RE shall maintain a website of their own in public domain, which shall be kept up to date, *inter-alia*, with the following details at a prominent single place on the website for ease of accessibility:

<span id="page-7-1"></span> <sup>5</sup> As per the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000, as amended from time to time.

v. In case of a loan default, when a recovery agent is assigned for recovery or there is a change in the recovery agent already assigned, the particulars of such recovery agent authorised to approach the borrower for recovery shall be communicated to the borrower through email/ SMS before the recovery agent contacts the borrower for recovery.

#### <span id="page-8-0"></span>9. **Loan disbursal, servicing and repayment**

- i. Disbursement of loan by the RE shall always be made into the bank account of the borrower except for disbursals covered exclusively under statutory or regulatory mandate (of RBI or of any other regulator), flow of money between REs for colending transactions[6](#page-8-1) and disbursals for specific end use, provided the loan is disbursed directly into the bank account of the end-beneficiary[7.](#page-8-2) RE shall ensure that in no case, disbursal is made to a third-party account, including the accounts of LSP, except as provided for in these Directions.
- ii. RE shall ensure that all loan servicing, repayment, etc. is executed by the borrower directly in the RE's bank account without any pass-through account/ pool account of any third party, including the accounts of LSP.
- iii. The flow of funds between the bank accounts of the borrower and the RE shall not be controlled either directly or indirectly by a third-party, including the LSP.
- iv. RE shall ensure that any fees, charges, reimbursements, etc. payable to LSP are paid directly by the RE and are not charged to or collected from the borrowers separately by LSP.

<span id="page-8-2"></span><span id="page-8-1"></span><sup>6</sup> Co-lending arrangements shall be governed by the extant instructions, as amended from time to time. This shall also cover co-lending arrangements between REs for non-PSL loans subject to the condition that no third party other than the REs in a co-lending transaction shall have direct or indirect control over the flow of funds at any point of time. <sup>7</sup> Advances against salary, where the loan is disbursed directly to the bank account of the borrower but the repayment is from the corporate employer, can be allowed subject to the condition that the loan is repaid by the corporate employer by deducting the amount from the borrower's salary. It must, however, be ensured that LSPs do not have any control over the flow of funds directly or indirectly in such transactions and that repayment is directly from the bank account of the employer to the RE.

v. In case of delinquent loans, RE may deploy physical interface to recover loans in cash, wherever necessary. In order to afford operational flexibility to RE, such transactions are exempted from the requirement of direct repayment of loan in the RE's bank account. However, any recovery by cash shall be duly reflected in full in the borrower's account on the same day and RE shall ensure that any fees, charges, etc., payable to LSPs for such recovery are paid directly by the RE and are not charged by LSP to the borrower either directly or indirectly from the recovery proceeds.

## <span id="page-9-0"></span>10.**Cooling-off period**

- i. The borrower shall be given an explicit option to exit a digital loan by paying the principal and the proportionate APR without any penalty during an initial "coolingoff period". The cooling off period shall be determined by the Board of the RE as laid down in their loan policy, subject to the period so determined not being less than one day. For borrower continuing with the loan even after cooling-off period, pre-payment shall continue to be allowed as per applicable RBI guidelines[8.](#page-9-2)

# **Annex II: Illustrations**

<span id="page-21-0"></span>*Note: Illustrations are provided for ease of understanding and are merely indicative and not exhaustive.*

#### Illustration 1

Assume that as on April 1, 2024 the RE earmarks a portfolio of ₹40 crore (out of the total **sanctioned** loans) under a DLG arrangement (DLG set). This portfolio shall remain "frozen" for the purpose of the specific DLG arrangement - meaning that no loan assets can be added or removed from it, except through loan repayment/ write-off. The RE can have such multiple DLG sets.

The ceiling for DLG cover on such portfolio shall be fixed at ₹2 crore (5% of ₹40 crore), which shall get activated proportionately as and when the loans are **disbursed**.

#### Illustration 2

Assume that out of the above DLG set, loans amounting to ₹10 crore are disbursed immediately. Then as on April 1, 2024, the DLG cover available for the portfolio shall be ₹0.5 crore (5% of disbursed).

Subsequently, if loans of ₹10 crore are further disbursed on April 15, 2024, the DLG cover shall proportionately increase to ₹1 crore effective April 15, 2024.

#### *(Refer table below also for summary of each case)*

**Case 1**: As on June 30, 2024, loans worth ₹5 crore mature without any default. In this case, the outstanding portfolio in the books of the RE would be ₹15 crore and the DLG cover shall remain at ₹1 crore.

**Case 2:** Subsequently, there is a default of ₹2 crore during Q2-2024 and consequently the RE invokes the entire DLG (₹1 crore[13\)](#page-21-1). In this case, as of Sept 30, 2024 the outstanding portfolio in the books of the RE shall be ₹15 crore (*₹20 crore original portfolio less ₹5 crore loans matured without default*) but no headroom for DLG will be available

<span id="page-21-1"></span> <sup>13</sup> It has been assumed that till date zero principal/interest have been received towards these loans.

as the maximum permissible DLG cover of ₹1 crore (5% of disbursed) has been exhausted.

**Case 3:** Going further, let's assume that recovery worth ₹1 crore is made by the RE during October 2024 on the defaulted loans of ₹2 crore. In such a case, the amount of the outstanding portfolio in the books of the RE as on October 31, 2024 shall come down to ₹14 crore *(₹20 crore original portfolio less ₹5 crore loans matured without any default less ₹1 crore loans which were in default and recovered).* However, the recovery amount of ₹1 crore cannot be added to reinstate the DLG cover.
