RBI/2021-22/136 DOR.CAP.REC.No.72/21.06.201/2021-22 December 08, 2021

Dear Sir/ Madam,

**General permission for infusion of capital in overseas branches and subsidiaries and retention/ repatriation/ transfer of profits in these centres by banks incorporated in India**

Please refer to para 1 of the ['Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=52688)  [dated December 8, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=52688) on the above subject.

2. As per extant practice, banks incorporated in India seek prior RBI approval for

- a) infusion of capital in their overseas branches and subsidiaries.
- b) retention of profits in, and transfer or repatriation of profits from these overseas centres.

3. In order to provide greater operational flexibility, it has been decided that prior RBI approval for above capital infusion/ transfers (including retention/ repatriation of profits), shall not be required by banks which meet the regulatory capital requirements (including capital buffers[1\)](#page-0-0). Instead, the banks shall seek approval of their boards for the same.

4. While considering such proposals, banks shall analyse all relevant aspects including *inter alia* the business plans, home and host country regulatory requirements and performance parameters of their overseas centres. Banks shall also ensure compliance with all applicable home and host country laws and regulations.
