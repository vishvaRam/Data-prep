2. (a) With a view to ensure prompt/immediate refund/credit to the government account in the cases of excess put through/ double claim in the payment scrolls by the agency banks, it has been decided in consultation with the O/o Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG) that penal interest for excess put through/ double claim amount may be levied by State Government as in the case of delayed credit of receipts.

(b).The penal interest period for such double claim/excess put through may start from the date on which the agency bank has received the excess put through / double claim amount and upto previous date to actual date of return of such excess put through / double claim amount by agency banks to concerned state government account (excluding the date of return of such excess payment/double claim amount by the agency banks to government account(s)).

(c) The rate of penal interest is Bank rate plus 2%. (The Bank Rate will be the rate notified by the RBI from time to time as applicable at the time of transaction).

3. These instructions will come into effect from date of issuance of this circular. The procedure for claiming/ recovering of delayed period interest will remain unchanged and it will be charged irrespective of the amount involved in such excess put through /double claim by agency banks.
