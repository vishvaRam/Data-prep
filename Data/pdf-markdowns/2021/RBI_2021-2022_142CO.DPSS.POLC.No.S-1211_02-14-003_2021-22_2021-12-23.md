At the request of industry stakeholders, this timeline was extended to December 31, 2021 vide circular [CO.DPSS.POLC.No.S33/02-14-008/2020-2021 dated March](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12050&Mode=0)  [31, 2021.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12050&Mode=0) Further, regulations on CoF Tokenisation (CoFT) were issued vide [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12159&Mode=0) [CO.DPSS.POLC.No.S-516/02-14-003/2021-22 dated September 07, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12159&Mode=0) on "*Tokenisation – Card Transactions: Permitting Card-on-File Tokenisation (CoFT) Services*".
