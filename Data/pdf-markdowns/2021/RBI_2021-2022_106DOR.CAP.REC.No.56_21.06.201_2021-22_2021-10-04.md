2. Several banks have approached us to clarify the amount of capital funds that can be raised overseas. The issue has been examined and it is clarified that the "eligible amount" for purpose of issue of PDIs in foreign currency as per para 1.16 (ii) of Annex 4 to the [Master Circular dated July 1, 2015](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9859) referred to above, would mean the higher of:

- (a) 1.5% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) and
- (b) Total Additional Tier 1 capital

as on March 31 of the previous financial year.

Not more than 49% of the "eligible amount" as above can be issued in foreign currency and/or in rupee denominated bonds overseas.
