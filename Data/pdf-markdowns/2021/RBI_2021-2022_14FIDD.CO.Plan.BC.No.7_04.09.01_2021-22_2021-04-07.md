Dear Sir/Madam

**Priority Sector Lending (PSL) – Increase in limits for bank lending against Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWRs) / electronic Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (eNWRs)**

Please refer to the [Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51382) dated April 7, [2021,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51382) wherein Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had announced increase in loan limits for bank lending against NWRs/eNWRs.

2. In terms of paras 8.1 (vii) and 8.2 (b) of the ["Master Direction on Priority Sector](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959)  Lending – [Targets and Classification" dated September 4, 2020,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) bank loans against pledge/ hypothecation of agricultural produce (including warehouse receipts) for a period not exceeding 12 months are eligible for classification under PSL, subject to a limit up to ₹50 lakh per borrower.

3. With a view to ensure greater flow of credit to the farmers against pledge/hypothecation of agricultural produce, and to encourage use of NWR/eNWR issued by regulated warehouses as a preferred instrument for availing such finance by the farmers, it has been decided to enhance the PSL limit for loans against NWRs/eNWRs from ₹50 lakh to ₹75 lakh per borrower. The PSL limit backed by the warehouse receipts other than NWR/eNWR will continue to be ₹50 lakh per borrower.

4. Consequent to the above change, para 8.1(vii) and 8.2(b) of the [Master Direction on](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959)  Priority Sector Lending – [Targets and Classification dated September 4, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) will stand modified as follows:
