11. It is clarified that the extant instructions on upper age limit for MD&CEO and WTDs in the private sector banks would continue and no person can continue as MD&CEO or WTD beyond the age of 70 years.

12. MD&CEO or WTD who is also a promoter/ major shareholder, cannot hold these posts for more than 12 years. However, in extraordinary circumstances, at the sole discretion of the Reserve Bank such MD&CEO or WTDs may be allowed to continue up to 15 years. While examining the matter of re-appointment of such MD&CEOs or WTDs within the 12/15 years period, the level of progress and adherence to the milestones for dilution of promoters' shareholding in the bank shall also be factored in by the Reserve Bank.

## **Transition Arrangement**

13. While the instructions shall come into effect from the date of issue of this circular, in order to enable smooth transition to the revised requirements, banks are permitted to comply with these instructions latest by October 01, 2021. Specifically:

(i) The Chair of board who is not an independent director on the date of issue of this circular shall be allowed to complete the current term as Chair as already approved by the Reserve Bank.

(ii) Banks with MD&CEOs or WTDs who have already completed 12/15 years as MD&CEO or WTD, on the date these instructions coming to effect, shall be allowed to complete their current term as already approved by the Reserve Bank.

Yours faithfully,
