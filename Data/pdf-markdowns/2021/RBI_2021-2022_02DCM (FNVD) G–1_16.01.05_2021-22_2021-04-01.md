#### **RESERVE BANK OF INDIA DEPARTMENT OF CURRENCY MANAGEMENT MASTER CIRCULAR – 2021-22**

## **Detection and Impounding of Counterfeit Notes**

## **Para 1- Authority to Impound Counterfeit Notes**

The Counterfeit Notes can be impounded by

- (i) All Banks
- (ii) All Treasuries and Sub-Treasuries.
- (iii) Issue Offices of Reserve Bank of India.

# **Para 2 - Detection of Counterfeit Notes**

Banknotes tendered over the counter should be examined for authenticity through machines.

Similarly, banknotes received directly at the back office / currency chest through bulk tenders should also be examined through machines.

No credit to customer's account is to be given for Counterfeit Notes, if any, detected in the tender received over the counter or at the back-office / currency chest.

In no case, the Counterfeit Notes should be returned to the tenderer or destroyed by the bank branches / treasuries. Failure of the banks to impound Counterfeit Notes detected at their end will be construed as wilful involvement of the bank concerned in circulating Counterfeit Notes and penalty will be imposed.

# **Para 3 - Impounding of Counterfeit Notes**

Notes determined as counterfeit shall be stamped as "COUNTERFEIT NOTE" and impounded in the prescribed format [\(Annex I\)](#page--1-0). Each such impounded note shall be recorded under authentication, in a separate register.

# **Para 4 - Issue of Receipt to Tenderer**

When a banknote tendered at the counter of a bank branch / back office and currency chest or treasury is found to be counterfeit, an acknowledgement receipt in the prescribed format [\(Annex II\)](#page--1-0) must be issued to the tenderer, after stamping the note as in Paragraph 3 ibid. The receipt, in running serial numbers, should be authenticated by the cashier and tenderer. Notice to this effect should be displayed prominently at the offices / branches for information of the public. The receipt is to be issued even in cases where the tenderer is unwilling to countersign it.

![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)

# **Para 5 - Detection of Counterfeit Notes - Reporting to Police and other bodies**

The following procedure should be followed while reporting incidence of detection of Counterfeit Note to the Police:

For cases of detection of Counterfeit Notes up to 4 pieces, in a single transaction, a consolidated report in the prescribed format [\(Annex III\)](#page--1-1) should be sent by the Nodal Bank Officer to the police authorities or the Nodal Police Station, along with the suspect Counterfeit Notes, at the end of the month.

For cases of detection of Counterfeit Notes of 5 or more pieces, in a single transaction, the Counterfeit Notes should be forwarded **immediately** by the Nodal Bank Officer to the local police authorities or the Nodal Police Station for investigation by filing FIR in the prescribed format [\(Annex IV\)](#page--1-0).

A copy of the monthly consolidated report / FIR shall be sent to the Forged Note Vigilance Cell constituted at the Head Office of the bank (only in the case of banks), and in the case of the treasury, it should be sent to the Issue Office of the Reserve Bank concerned.

Acknowledgement of the police authorities concerned has to be obtained for note/s forwarded to them both as consolidated monthly statement and for filing of FIR. If the Counterfeit Notes are sent to the police by insured post, acknowledgement of receipt thereof by the police should be invariably obtained and kept on record. A proper follow-up of receipt of acknowledgement from the police authorities is necessary. In case any difficulty is faced by the Offices / Branches due to reluctance of the police to receive monthly consolidated statement / file FIRs, the matter may be sorted out in consultation with the Nodal Officer of the police authority designated to coordinate matters relating to investigation of Counterfeit Banknotes cases. The list of Nodal Police Stations may be obtained from the Regional Office concerned of the Reserve Bank of India.

In order to facilitate identification of people abetting circulation of Counterfeit Notes, banks are advised to cover the banking hall / area and counters under CCTV surveillance and recording and preserve the recording.

Banks should also monitor the patterns / trends of such detection and suspicious trends / patterns should be brought to the notice of RBI / Police authorities immediately.

The progress made by banks in detection and reporting of Counterfeit Notes to Police, RBI, etc. and problems thereof, should be discussed regularly in the meetings of various State Level Committees viz. State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC), Standing Committee on Currency Management (SCCM), State Level Security Committee (SLSC), etc.

![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)

The data on detection of counterfeit Indian notes at bank branches and treasuries should be included in the monthly returns forwarded to the Reserve Bank Issue Offices as indicated in [para 10](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=10517&fn=2753&Mode=0#10) below.

The definition of 'counterfeiting' in the Indian Penal Code covers currency notes issued by a foreign government authority as well. In case of suspected foreign currency note received for opinion from the police and government agencies, etc., they should be advised to forward the case to the Interpol Wing of the CBI, New Delhi after prior consultation with them.

The Government of India has framed Investigation of High Quality Counterfeit Indian Currency Offences Rules, 2013 under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967. The Third Schedule of the Act defines High Quality Counterfeit Indian Currency Note. Activity of production, smuggling or circulation of High Quality Counterfeit Indian Notes has been brought under the ambit of UAPA, 1967.

## **Para 6 - Examination of the Banknotes before Issuing over Counters, Feeding ATMs and Remitting to Issue Offices of the Reserve Bank**

The banks should re-align their cash management in such a manner so as to ensure that cash receipts in the denominations of ₹100 and above are not put into recirculation without the notes being machine processed for authenticity. The said instructions shall be applicable to all bank branches, irrespective of the volume of daily cash receipt. Any non-compliance will be construed as violation of the [Directive](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5376&Mode=0#M)  [No.3158/09.39.00 \(Policy\)/2009-10 dated November 19, 2009](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5376&Mode=0#M) issued by the Reserve Bank.

In order to obviate complaints regarding receipt of Counterfeit Notes through ATMs, and to curb circulation of counterfeits, it is imperative to put in place adequate safeguards / checks before loading ATMs with notes. Dispensation of Counterfeit Notes through the ATMs would be construed as an attempt to circulate the Counterfeit Notes by the bank concerned.

Detection of counterfeits in chest remittances is also liable to be construed as wilful involvement of the chest branches concerned in circulating Counterfeit Notes and may attract special investigation by police authorities, and other action like suspending the operation of the chest concerned.

Penalty at 100% of the notional value of Counterfeit Notes, in addition to the recovery of loss to the extent of the notional value of such notes, will be imposed under the following circumstances:
