Madam / Sir,

## **Declaration of dividends by banks**

2. In view of the continuing uncertainty caused by the ongoing second wave of COVID-19 in the country, it is crucial that banks remain resilient and proactively raise and conserve capital as a bulwark against unexpected losses.

## **General**

5. All banks shall continue to meet the applicable minimum regulatory capital requirements after dividend payment. While declaring dividend on equity shares, it shall be the responsibility of the Board of Directors to *inter-alia* consider the current and projected capital position of the bank vis-à-vis the applicable capital requirements and the adequacy of provisions, taking into account the economic environment and the outlook for profitability.

Yours faithfully,

-sd-

(Usha Janakiraman) Chief General Manager
