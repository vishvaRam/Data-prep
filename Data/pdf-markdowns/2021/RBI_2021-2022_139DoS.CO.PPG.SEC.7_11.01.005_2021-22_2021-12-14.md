Dear Sir / Madam,

## **Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)**

Reserve Bank of India had introduced a [Prompt Corrective Action Framework \(PCA\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=1014&Mode=0) for Scheduled Commercial Banks in 2002 and the same has been reviewed from time to time based on the experience gained and developments in the banking system. The objective of the PCA Framework is to enable Supervisory intervention at appropriate time and require the Supervised Entity to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, so as to restore its financial health. The PCA Framework is also intended to act as a tool for effective market discipline. The PCA Framework does not preclude the Reserve Bank of India from taking any other action as it deems fit at any time in addition to the corrective actions prescribed in the Framework.

<span id="page-0-1"></span><sup>2</sup> "Public funds" shall include funds raised either directly or indirectly through public deposits, Commercial Papers, debentures, inter-corporate deposits and bank finance but excludes funds raised by issue of instruments compulsorily convertible into equity shares within a period not exceeding 5 years from the date of issue.

2. NBFCs have been growing in size and have substantial interconnectedness with other segments of the financial system. Accordingly, it has now been decided to put in place a PCA Framework for NBFCs to further strengthen the supervisory tools applicable to NBFCs. The PCA Framework for NBFCs, as contained in the enclosed [Annex,](#page--1-0) comes into effect from October 1, 2022, based on the financial position of NBFCs on or after March 31, 2022.

3. In terms of extant regulations, Government NBFCs have been provided time upto March 31, 2022 to adhere to the capital adequacy norms provided for NBFCs (Ref. Annex I of Non-Banking Financial Company - [Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10586)  [Company and Deposit taking Company \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2016\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10586). Accordingly, a separate circular would be issued in due course with regard to applicability of PCA Framework to Government NBFCs.

4. The PCA Framework will be reviewed after three years of being in operation.

Yours faithfully,

#### **(Ajay Kumar Choudhary) Chief General Manager-in-Charge**

Enclosure: PCA Framework for NBFCs

# **PCA Framework for NBFCs**

- A. The PCA Framework is applicable to the following category of NBFCs:
	- a. All Deposit Taking NBFCs [Excluding Government Companies] (NBFCs-D)
	- b. All Non-Deposit Taking NBFCs in Middle, Upper and Top Layers[3](#page--1-1) (NBFCs-ND);

[Including Investment and Credit Companies, Core Investment Companies (CICs), Infrastructure Debt Funds, Infrastructure Finance Companies, Micro Finance Institutions and Factors]; but

[Excluding – (i) NBFCs not accepting/not intending to accept public funds[4;](#page--1-2) (ii) Government Companies, (iii) Primary Dealers and (iv) Housing Finance Companies]

B. For NBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND, Capital and Asset Quality would be the key areas for monitoring in PCA Framework.

For CICs, Capital, Leverage and Asset Quality would be the key areas for monitoring in PCA Framework.

- C. For NBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND, indicators to be tracked would be Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR), Tier I Capital Ratio and Net NPA Ratio (NNPA). For CICs, indicators to be tracked would be Adjusted Net Worth/Aggregate Risk Weighted Assets, Leverage Ratio and NNPA.
- D. A NBFC will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the audited Annual Financial Results and/or the Supervisory Assessment made by the RBI. However, the RBI may impose PCA on any NBFC during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant.
- E. The Reserve Bank may issue a press release when a NBFC is placed under PCA as well as when PCA is withdrawn vis-à-vis a NBFC.

G. Exit from PCA and Withdrawal of Restrictions under PCA - Once a NBFC is placed under PCA, taking the NBFC out of PCA Framework and/or withdrawal of restrictions imposed under the PCA Framework will be considered: a) if no breaches in risk thresholds in any of the parameters are observed as per four continuous quarterly financial statements, one of which should be Annual Audited Financial Statement (subject to assessment by RBI); and b) based on Supervisory comfort of the RBI, including an assessment on sustainability of profitability of the NBFC.
