(iii) The choice of accrediting an agency bank (including scheduled private sector agency bank) for any particular government agency business rests solely with the concerned Central Government Departments /State Governments. Further, Government Departments /State Governments have the option to discontinue the arrangement after giving notice to the concerned agency banks, keeping RBI informed.

(iv) The procedure to be followed to accredit an agency bank ((including scheduled private sector agency bank) will be as under:

- a) **For Central Government/Union Territory business**: For Central Government/Union Territory business, the concerned Civil/Non-Civil Ministry/Department may work out the arrangement with the agency bank and send the proposal of accreditation of the agency bank/providing new/additional government agency business to the O/o CGA for examination.

- b) **For State Government business**: The concerned Department of the State Government may work out the arrangement and approach the Finance Department of the State Government which will recommend the proposal for accreditation of the agency bank/providing new/additional government agency

business to the concerned Regional Director of RBI, who will forward the case with his/her comments to the DGBA, CO for approval and further action.

(vi) It may please be noted that performance of the agency banks, on a matrix of various Government initiatives and Schemes, may be reviewed from time to time by the Government in consultation with RBI based on which the permission given to the concerned bank to undertake Government business could be potentially withdrawn.
