RBI/2021-22/118 DOS.CO.PPG.SEC.No.4/11.01.005/2021-22 November 02, 2021

All Scheduled Commercial Banks (Excluding Small Finance Banks, Payment Banks and Regional Rural Banks)

Madam/ Dear Sir,

**Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for Scheduled Commercial Banks** Please refer to the [circular No. DBS.CO.PPD.BC.No.8/11.01.005/2016-17 dated April](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10921&Mode=0)  [13, 2017](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10921&Mode=0) on the Revised Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs).

2. The existing PCA Framework for SCBs has since been reviewed and revised. The revised Framework is provided in the **[Annex](#page--1-0)**.

3. The provisions of the revised PCA Framework will be effective from January 1, 2022.

4. The objective of the PCA Framework is to enable Supervisory intervention at appropriate time and require the Supervised Entity to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, so as to restore its financial health. The PCA Framework is also intended to act as a tool for effective market discipline. The PCA Framework does not preclude the Reserve Bank of India from taking any other action as it deems fit at any time, in addition to the corrective actions prescribed in the Framework.

5. The contents of the circular may be brought to the attention of the bank's Board of Directors.

Yours faithfully

- A. Capital, Asset Quality and Leverage will be the key areas for monitoring in the revised framework.

- D. The PCA Framework would apply to all banks operating in India including foreign banks operating through branches or subsidiaries based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators.
- E. A bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Audited Annual Financial Results and the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. RBI may impose PCA on any bank during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant.
- F. Exit from PCA and Withdrawal of Restrictions under PCA Once a bank is placed under PCA, taking the bank out of PCA Framework and/or withdrawal of restrictions imposed under the PCA Framework will be considered: a) if no breaches in risk thresholds in any of the parameters are observed as per four continuous quarterly financial statements, one of which should be Audited Annual Financial Statement (subject to assessment by RBI); and b) based on Supervisory comfort of the RBI, including an assessment on sustainability of profitability of the bank.

G.When a bank is placed under PCA, one or more of the following corrective actions may be prescribed:
