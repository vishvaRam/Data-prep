All Payment System Providers and Payment System Participants

Madam / Dear Sir,

# **Guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways**

We invite a reference to our circular [DPSS.CO.PD.No.1810/02.14.008/2019-20 dated March 17,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0)  [2020](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0) (*as updated from time to time*) and the clarification dated September 17, 2020 issued on the subject [\(Annex\)](#page-1-0). Accordingly, neither the authorised Payment Aggregators (PAs) nor the merchants on-boarded by them can store customer card credentials within their database or server.

2. Based on the representations received from the industry seeking additional time for implementing the above instructions, it has been decided, as a one-time measure, to extend the timeline for non-bank PAs by six months, i.e., till December 31, 2021, to enable the payment system providers and participants to put in place workable solutions, such as tokenisation, within the framework set out in the [circular dated March 17, 2020](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0) cited above and our [circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11449&Mode=0)  [DPSS.CO.PD No.1463/02.14.003/2018-19 dated January 08, 2019](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11449&Mode=0) on "Tokenisation – Card transactions". All other provisions of the [circular dated March 17, 2020](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0) referred to above, shall remain unchanged.

3. This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).

Yours faithfully,

(P. Vasudevan) Chief General Manager

- 4.2. For merchant on-boarding, the PA can have a Board approved policy (Para 7.1).

### 6. **Security, fraud prevention and risk management framework related**

- 6.1. The PA needs to ensure compliance of the infrastructure of the merchants to security standards like PCI-DSS and PA-DSS, as applicable.
- 6.2. Merchants are not allowed to store payment data irrespective of their being PCI-DSS compliant or otherwise. They shall, however, be allowed to store limited data for the purpose of transaction tracking; for which, the required limited information may be stored in compliance with the applicable standards.

- 7.3. The existing entities can continue to maintain nodal accounts till they have been authorised by RBI. Since the PA needs to move towards an escrow account, the bank and the PA may take a call about maintaining the same from an earlier date as well. However, this alone shall not make them eligible for a "designated payment system" status under Section 23A of the PSS Act.
- 7.4. If the bank can satisfactorily establish that the nodal account of an entity has been migrated to escrow account in compliance with the new instructions, it can allow the balances under existing nodal accounts of PAs to be considered for calculation of 'Core portion'.
- 7.5. Those entities who have not attained the requisite net-worth as of March 31, 2021 shall wind up their PA business. Banks shall be required to close such nodal accounts after June 30, 2021 unless the PA produces evidence to the bank regarding application for authorisation being made to RBI.
