Please refer to the instructions contained in Section 7 of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10296) (MD) on [Interest Rate on Deposits dated March 03, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10296) and [Master Direction -](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10394) Reserve Bank of India (Co-operative Banks - [Interest Rate on Deposits\) Directions, 2016 dated May 12,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10394)  [2016.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10394) In terms of these instructions, banks have been permitted to offer domestic term deposits (TDs) without premature withdrawal option, provided that all TDs accepted from individuals for an amount of Rupees fifteen lakh and below shall have prematurewithdrawal-facility. Further, the banks have also been permitted to offer differential rate on interest on TDs based on non-callability of deposits (i.e., non-availability of premature withdrawal option) in addition to tenor and size of deposits.

2. On a review, it has been decided that (i) the minimum amount for offering non-callable TDs may be increased from Rupees fifteen lakh to Rupees one crore i.e., all domestic term deposits accepted from individuals for amount of Rupees one crore and below shall have premature-withdrawal-facility and (ii) these instructions shall also be applicable for Non-Resident (External) Rupee (NRE) Deposit / Ordinary Non-Resident (NRO) Deposits.

3. Accordingly, the relevant sections of the Master Direction have been amended as indicated in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)
