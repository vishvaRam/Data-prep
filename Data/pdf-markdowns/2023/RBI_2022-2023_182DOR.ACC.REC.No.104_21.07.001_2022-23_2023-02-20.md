## RBI/2022-23/182 DOR.ACC.REC.No.104/21.07.001/2022-23 February 20, 2023

Dear Sir/ Madam,

## **Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)**

Please refer to circular DOR [\(NBFC\).CC.PD.No.109/22.10.106/2019-20 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11818&Mode=0)  March [13, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11818&Mode=0) on the captioned subject read with paragraph 13 (iii) of [Master Circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12267) [DOR.SIG.FIN.REC 1/26.03.001/2022-23 dated April 1, 2022](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12267) on Asset Reconstruction Companies.

2. It has been observed that consequent to the implementation of Ind AS, some Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) have been recognising management fees even though the said fee had not been realised for more than 180 days.

3. To address the prudential concerns arising from continued recognition of unrealised income, it has been decided that ARCs preparing their financial statements as per Ind AS, shall reduce the following amounts from their net owned funds while calculating the Capital Adequacy Ratio and the amount available for payment of dividend:

- (a) Management fee recognised during the planning period[1](#page-0-0) that remains unrealised beyond 180 days from the date of expiry of the planning period.
- (b) Management fee recognised after the expiry of the planning period that remains unrealised beyond 180 days of such recognition.
- (c) Any unrealised management fees, notwithstanding the period for which it has remained unrealised, where the net asset value of the Security Receipts has fallen below 50 per cent of the face value.

The amount reduced from net owned funds and amount available for payment of dividend shall be net of any specific expected credit loss allowances held on unrealised management fee referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) and the tax implications thereon, if any.
