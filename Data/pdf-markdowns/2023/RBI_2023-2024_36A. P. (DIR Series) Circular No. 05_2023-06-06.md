RBI/2023-24/36 A. P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 05 June 06, 2023

All Authorised Dealer Category – I Banks

Madam / Sir,

## **Risk Management and Inter-Bank Dealings - Non-deliverable derivative contracts (NDDCs)**

Please refer to Paragraph 1 of the [Statement on Developmental and Regulatory](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55473)  [Policies](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55473) announced as a part of the [first Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement for](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55472)  [2023-24 dated April 06, 2023](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=55472) regarding development of the onshore non-deliverable derivative market. Attention of Authorised Dealers Category – I (AD Cat-I) banks is invited to the Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts) Regulations, 2000 dated May 3, 2000 [\(Notification No. FEMA.25/RB-2000](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=179&Mode=0)  [dated May 3, 2000\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=179&Mode=0), as amended from time to time, and [Master Direction –](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10485) Risk [Management and Inter-Bank Dealings dated July 5, 2016,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10485) as amended from time to time.

2. As per the extant regulatory framework, AD Cat-I banks operating International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) Banking Units (IBUs) are permitted to offer nondeliverable derivative contracts (NDDCs) to persons resident outside India. Such derivatives are cash-settled in foreign currency. With a view to developing the onshore INR NDDC market and providing residents the flexibility to efficiently design their hedging programmes, it has been decided to permit:

(a) AD Cat-I banks operating IBUs to offer NDDCs involving INR to resident non-retail users for the purpose of hedging. Such transactions shall be cash settled in INR; and

(b) The flexibility of cash settlement of NDDCs transactions between two AD Cat-I banks, and between an AD Cat-I bank and a person resident outside India in INR or any foreign currency.

3. Accordingly, the amendments being made to the [Master Direction](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10485) – Risk [Management and Inter-Bank Dealings dated July 5, 2016,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10485) as amended from time to time, are placed at [Annex](#page-2-0) herewith.

4. The directions contained in this circular have been issued under Sections 10(4) and 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and are without prejudice to permissions/ approvals, if any, required under any other law.

Yours faithfully,

(Dimple Bhandia) Chief General Manager
