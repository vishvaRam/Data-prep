RBI/2023-24/32 DCM(Plg) No.S-236/10.27.00/2023-24 May 19, 2023

The Chairman / Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer All Banks

Dear Sir /Madam,

## **₹2000 Denomination Banknotes – Withdrawal from Circulation; Will continue as Legal Tender**

₹2000 denomination banknote was introduced in [November 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=38522) under Section 24(1) of RBI Act, 1934 primarily to meet the immediate currency requirement of the economy after withdrawal of the legal tender status of all ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes in circulation at that time. With fulfilment of the objective of introduction of ₹2000 denomination and availability of banknotes in other denominations in adequate quantity, printing of ₹2000 banknotes was stopped in 2018-19.

2. Further, majority of the ₹2000 denomination notes were issued prior to March 2017, have completed their estimated lifespan and are not observed to be commonly used for transactions anymore. Therefore, it has been decided that, in pursuance of the "Clean Note Policy" of the Reserve Bank of India, the ₹2000 denomination banknotes shall be withdrawn from circulation. The ₹2000 banknotes will continue to be legal tender.

3. Accordingly, to implement the decision stated above, the following plan of action has been formulated which, the banks shall follow meticulously:

# **A. Handling of existing stock and receipts**

(i) All banks shall discontinue issue of ₹2000 denomination banknotes with immediate effect. ATMs/Cash Recyclers may also be reconfigured accordingly.
