The LRS monthly return and LRS daily return have been assigned return codes- 'R089' and 'R010' respectively on CIMS portal.

3. Accordingly, AD Category-I banks shall upload the LRS monthly return on or before fifth of the succeeding month commencing from the reporting month of December 2023, and LRS daily return from December 26, 2023 onwards on the next working day on CIMS portal (URL: [https://sankalan.rbi.org.in\)](https://sankalan.rbi.org.in/). In case no data is to be furnished, AD Category-I banks shall upload a 'NIL' report.

4. AD Category-I banks may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of their constituents.

5. The directions contained in this circular have been issued under Section 10 (4) and 11 (1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and are without prejudice to permissions/approvals, if any, required under any other law.
