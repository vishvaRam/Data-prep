## RBI/2023-24/25 DOR.AML.REC.13/14.01.001/2023-24 May 4, 2023

The Chairpersons/ CEOs of all the Regulated Entities

Dear Sir/Madam,

## **Amendment to the Master Direction (MD) on KYC – Instructions on Wire Transfer**

Please refer to the Master Direction (MD) [on KYC dated February 25, 2016,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) as amended from time to time, in terms of which Regulated Entities (REs), *inter alia*, have to undertake certain measures while dealing with the Wire Transfer.

2. In this regard, on a review, it has been decided to amend the MD on KYC to update the instructions on Wire Transfer (Section 64 of the MD), also aligning the same with the relevant FATF Recommendation. The amended instructions of Section 64 of the MD on KYC are provided in the [annexure](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/NT2504052023_AN.pdf) for reference. Further, definitions of the relevant terms used in the amended Wire Transfer instructions are being added in Section 2 ("Definitions") of the MD on KYC.

3. The amended provisions shall come into force with immediate effect.

Yours faithfully,

(Santosh Kumar Panigrahy) Chief General Manager
