The [appendix](#page--1-0) to this questionnaire additionally contains questions, which are relevant to the specialized branches dealing in foreign exchange transactions, branches having very large advances, recovery of nonperforming assets (NPA) and clearing house operations, if any. Auditors of foreign branches of Indian banks should also furnish this report.

The overall objective of the branch audit should be to have transaction testing and provide inputs to the Statutory central Auditors on adequacy of implementation of various policy and regulatory requirements, including efficacy of the system and assurance functions (risk management, compliance and internal audit) at branch level.
- ii. The threshold fixed for different purposes for comments in the LFAR will decide that above the threshold, the transaction detailing needs to be seen and commented upon. However, below the threshold, the system and processes should be checked and commented upon.
- iii. Verification of data integrity and data related control systems and processes should be carried out and commented upon, with the special thrust on those data inputs which are to be used for MIS at corporate office level and for supervisory reporting purposes.
- iv. Where any of the comments made by the auditors in their LFAR is adverse, they should consider whether a qualification in their main report is necessary. It should not, however, be assumed that every adverse comment in the LFAR would necessarily result in a qualification in the main report. In deciding whether a qualification in the main report is necessary, the auditors should use their professional judgment in the facts and circumstances of each case.
