2. In this regard, it has been decided by the Government of India to bring, inter alia, following modifications in the operational guidelines:

- (ii) Acceptance of claims in multiple lots for a given half year by eligible institutions.
- (iii) Requirement of Udyog Aadhar Number (UAN) may be dispensed with for units eligible for GST. Unit not required to obtain GST, may either submit Income Tax Permanent Account Number (PAN) or their loan account must be categorized as MSME by the concerned bank.
