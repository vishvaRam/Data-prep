All Scheduled Commercial Banks / Authorised Prepaid Payment Instrument Issuers / Payment Aggregators / Payment System Providers / System Participants

Madam / Dear Sir,

## **Maintenance of Escrow Account with a Scheduled Commercial Bank**

A reference is invited to the instructions issued by Reserve Bank of India vide (a) [DPSS.CO.PD.No.1164/02.14.006/2017-18 dated October 11, 2017](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11142&Mode=0) (updated as on February 28, 2020) on 'Issuance and Operation of Prepaid Payment Instruments (PPIs)'; and (b) [DPSS.CO.PD.No.1810/02.14.008/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11822&Mode=0) on 'Regulation of Payment Aggregators (PAs) and Payment Gateways (PGs)'.

2. An authorised PPI Issuer or a PA is required to maintain an escrow account with a scheduled commercial bank on an ongoing basis. With a view to diversify risk and address business continuity concerns, it has been decided to allow one additional escrow account in a different scheduled commercial bank. The relevant instructions are being modified as per [Annex 1](#page-1-0) and [2](#page-3-0) to this circular. Redundant

3. These directions are issued under Section 18 read with Section 10(2) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007.

Yours faithfully,
