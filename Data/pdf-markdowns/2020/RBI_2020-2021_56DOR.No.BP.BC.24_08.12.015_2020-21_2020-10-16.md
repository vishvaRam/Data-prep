Dear Sir/Madam,

## **Individual Housing Loans – Rationalisation of Risk Weights**

Please refer to paragraph 6 of the [Statement on Developmental and Regulatory](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50480)  [Policies dated October 9, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50480) on rationalization of risk weights on Individual Housing Loans.

2. In terms of [circular No. DBR.BP.BC.No.72/08.12.015/2016-17 dated June 7, 2017,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10995&Mode=0) the capital charge for claims secured by residential property falling under the category of individual housing loans is assigned differential risk weights based on the size of the loan as well as the loan to value ratio (LTV).

3. As a countercyclical measure, it has been decided to rationalise the risk weights, irrespective of the amount. The risk weights for all new housing loans to be sanctioned on or after the date of this circular and upto March 31, 2022 shall be as under:

| LTV Ratio (%) | Risk Weight (%) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| ≤ 80          | 35              |
| > 80 and ≤ 90 | 50              |
