Also refer to the [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10756&Mode=0)  [DBR.BP.BC.No.42/08.12.014/2016-17 dated December 1, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10756&Mode=0) advising that for the purpose of definition of 'Infrastructure Lending', banks and select All India Term-Lending and Refinancing Institutions may be guided by the Gazette Notifications issued by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, from time to time.

2. For the purpose of [circular dated July 15, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9103&Mode=0) mentioned above, 'Infrastructure Sub-sectors' and 'affordable housing' have been defined under paragraphs 2(i) and 2(ii) of the Annex therein. Affordable housing[1](#page-0-0) has since been included in the harmonised master list (HML) of infrastructure subsectors issued vide gazette notification dated March 30, 2017. For lending to infrastructure sector, banks/FIs shall continue to follow the definition of affordable housing projects as per the definition in the HML, as amended from time to time.

<span id="page-0-0"></span> <sup>1</sup> "Affordable Housing" is defined as a housing project using at least 50% of the Floor Area Ratio (FAR)/Floor Space Index (FSI) for dwelling units with carpet area@ of not more than 60 square meters.

<sup>@ &</sup>quot;Carpet Area" shall have the same meaning as assigned to it in clause (k) of section 2 of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.

3.
