Dear Sir / Madam

## **Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 – Maintenance of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) – Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)**

Please refer to our [circular DOR.No.Ret.BC.52/12.01.001/2019-20](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11838&Mode=0) dated March 27, 2020 on Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) Scheme.

2. As announced in the Statement [of Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated March](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582)  [27, 2020,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582) the borrowing limit of scheduled banks under the MSF scheme, by dipping into the prescribed SLR, was increased from 2 per cent to 3 per cent of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) outstanding at the end of the second preceding fortnight with immediate effect. This relaxation was available up to June 30, 2020.
