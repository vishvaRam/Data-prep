Madam/Dear Sir,

# **Co-Lending by Banks and NBFCs to Priority Sector**

Please refer to the [circular FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.08/04.09.01/2018-19 dated September](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11376&Mode=0)  [21, 2018](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11376&Mode=0) on co-origination of loans by banks and NBFCs for lending to priority sector. The arrangement entailed joint contribution of credit at the facility level by both the lenders as also sharing of risks and rewards.

2. Based on the feedback received from the stakeholders and to better leverage the respective comparative advantages of the banks and NBFCs in a collaborative effort, it has been decided to provide greater operational flexibility to the lending institutions, while requiring them to conform to the regulatory guidelines on outsourcing, KYC, etc. The primary focus of the revised scheme, rechristened as "Co-Lending Model" (CLM), is to improve the flow of credit to the unserved and underserved sector of the economy and make available funds to the ultimate beneficiary at an affordable cost, considering the lower cost of funds from banks and greater reach of the NBFCs. Detailed features of the CLM are furnished in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)

3. In terms of the CLM, banks are permitted to co-lend with all registered NBFCs (including HFCs) based on a prior agreement. The co-lending banks will take their share of the individual loans on a back-to-back basis in their books. However, NBFCs shall be required to retain a minimum of 20 per cent share of the individual loans on their books.

Please do not respond in any manner to such offers.

4. The banks and NBFCs shall formulate Board approved policies for entering into the CLM and place the approved policies on their websites. Based on their Board approved policies, a Master Agreement may be entered into between the two partner institutions which shall *inter-alia* include, terms and conditions of the arrangement, the criteria for selection of partner institutions, the specific product lines and areas of operation, along with provisions related to segregation of responsibilities as well as customer interface and protection issues, as detailed in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)

5. The Master Agreement may provide for the banks to either mandatorily take their share of the individual loans originated by the NBFCs in their books as per the terms of the agreement, or to retain the discretion to reject certain loans after their due diligence prior to taking in their books, subject to the conditions specified in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)

6. The banks can claim priority sector status in respect of their share of credit while engaging in the CLM adhering to the specified conditions.

7. The CLM shall not be applicable to foreign banks (including WOS) with less than 20 branches.

8. This circular supersedes the [circular FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.08/04.09.01/2018-19 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11376&Mode=0)  [September 21, 2018.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11376&Mode=0) However, outstanding loans in terms of the circular *ibid* would continue to be classified under priority sector till their repayment or maturity, whichever is earlier.

Yours faithfully,

(Gautam Prasad Borah) Chief General Manager-in-Charge

# <span id="page-2-0"></span>**Essential Features of Co-Lending Model between Banks and NBFCs**

#### **I. Scope**

- 1. The Master Agreement entered into by the banks and NBFCs for implementing the CLM may provide either for the bank to mandatorily take their share of the individual loans as originated by the NBFC in their books or retain the discretion to reject certain loans subject to its due diligence.
	- a. If the Agreement entails a prior, irrevocable commitment on the part of the bank to take into its books its share of the individual loans as originated by the NBFC, the arrangement must comply with the extant guidelines on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services by Banks issued vide *[RBI/2014-15/497/DBR.No.BP.BC.76/21.04.158/2014-15 dated March 11, 2015](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9597&Mode=0)* and updated from time to time. In particular, the partner bank and NBFC shall have to put in place suitable mechanisms for *ex-ante* due diligence by the bank as the credit sanction process cannot be outsourced under the extant guidelines.

The bank shall also be required to comply with the Master Directions Know Your Customer (KYC) Direction, 2016, issued vide *[RBI/DBR/2015-16/18](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) Master [Direction DBR.AML.BC.No.81/14.01.001/2015-16 dated February 25, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566)* and updated from time to time, which already permit regulated entities, at their option, to rely on customer due diligence done by a third party, subject to specified conditions.
	- c. However, if the bank can exercise its discretion regarding taking into its books the loans originated by NBFC as per the Agreement, the arrangement will be akin to a direct assignment transaction. Accordingly, the taking over bank shall ensure compliance with all the requirements in terms of Guidelines on Transactions Involving Transfer of Assets through Direct Assignment of Cash Flows and the Underlying Securities issued vide *[RBI/2011-12/540](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=7184)  [DBOD.No.BP.BC-103/21.04.177/2011-12 dated May 07, 2012](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=7184) and [RBI//2012-](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=7517&Mode=0) [13/170 DNBS.

- 5. The ultimate borrower may be charged an all-inclusive interest rate as may be agreed upon by both the lenders conforming to the extant guidelines applicable to both.
- 6. The extant guidelines relating to customer service and fair practices code and the obligations enjoined upon the banks and NBFCs therein shall be applicable *mutatis mutandis* in respect of loans given under the arrangement.
