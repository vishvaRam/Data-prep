# **Guidelines on Regulation of Payment Aggregators and Payment Gateways**

**(**DPSS.CO.PD.No.1810/02.14.008/2019-20 dated March 17, 2020)

Payment Aggregators (PAs) and Payment Gateways (PGs) are intermediaries playing an important function in facilitating payments in the online space.

## 1. **Definitions**

- 1.1. For the purpose of this circular, the PAs and PGs are defined as under:
	- 1.1.1. PAs are entities that facilitate e-commerce sites and merchants to accept various payment instruments from the customers for completion of their payment obligations without the need for merchants to create a separate payment integration system of their own. PAs facilitate merchants to connect with acquirers. In the process, they receive payments from customers, pool and transfer them on to the merchants after a time period.
	- 1.1.2. PGs are entities that provide technology infrastructure to route and facilitate processing of an online payment transaction without any involvement in handling of funds.
- 1.2. In the processing of an online transaction the following timelines are involved:
	- *'Tp'* date of charge / debit to the customer's account against the purchase of goods / services.
	- '*Ts'* date of intimation by the merchant to the intermediary about shipment of goods.
	- *'Td'* date of confirmation by the merchant to the intermediary about delivery of goods to the customer.
	- *'Tr'* date of expiry of refund period as fixed by the merchant.

# 2. **Applicability**

- 2.1. The guidelines shall be applicable to PAs. PAs shall also adopt the technology-related recommendations provided in [Annex 2.](#page--1-1) As a measure of good practice, the PGs may adhere to these baseline technology-related recommendations.
- 2.2. Domestic leg of import and export related payments facilitated by PAs shall also be governed by these instructions.
- 2.3. The guidelines are not applicable to Cash on Delivery (CoD) e-commerce model.

## 3. **Authorisation**

- 3.1. The criteria of authorisation has been arrived at based on the role of the intermediary in handling of funds.
- 3.2. Bank and non-bank PAs handle funds as part of their activities. Banks, however, provide PA services as part of their normal banking relationship and do not therefore require a separate authorisation from RBI. Non-bank PAs shall require authorisation from RBI under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (PSSA).
- 3.3. PA shall be a company incorporated in India under the Companies Act, 1956 / 2013. The Memorandum of Association (MoA) of the applicant entity must cover the proposed activity of operating as a PA.
- 3.4. Existing non-bank entities offering PA services shall apply for authorisation on or before June 30, 2021. They shall be allowed to continue their operations till they receive communication from RBI regarding the fate of their application.
- 3.5. Entities seeking authorisation as PA from the RBI under the PSS Act, shall apply in [Form A](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Forms/PDFs/PSSACRT130215.PDF) to the Department of Payment and Settlement Systems (DPSS), RBI, Central Office, Mumbai. Entities regulated by any of the financial sector regulators shall apply along with a 'No Objection Certificate' from their respective regulator, within 45 days of obtaining such a clearance.
- 3.6. E-commerce marketplaces providing PA services shall not continue this activity beyond the deadline prescribed at clause 3.4 above. If they desire to pursue this activity, it shall be separated from the marketplace business and they shall apply for authorisation on or before June 30, 2021.
- 3.7. PGs shall be considered as 'technology providers' or 'outsourcing partners' of banks or nonbanks, as the case may be. In case of a bank PG, the guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India, Department of Regulation (DoR) vide [circular No.DBOD.NO.BP.40/21.04.158/2006-07](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3148&Mode=0)  [dated November 3, 2006](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3148&Mode=0) on "Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in Outsourcing of Financial Services by banks" and other follow up circular(s) shall also be applicable.
