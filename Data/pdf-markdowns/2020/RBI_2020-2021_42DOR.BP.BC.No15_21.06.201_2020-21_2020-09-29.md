3. The pre-specified trigger for loss absorption through conversion / write-down of Additional Tier 1 instruments (Perpetual Non-Convertible Preference Shares and Perpetual Debt Instruments), shall remain at 5.5 per cent of risk weighted assets (RWAs) and will rise to 6.125 per cent of RWAs from April 1, 2021.
