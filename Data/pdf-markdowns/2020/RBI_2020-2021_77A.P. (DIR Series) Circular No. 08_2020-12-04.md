Madam / Sir,

# **External Trade – Facilitation - Export of Goods and Services**

Please refer to the [Statement on Development and Regulatory Polices announced as part of](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50748)  [Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement dated December 4, 2020.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=50748) With a view to further enhance the ease of doing business and quicken the approval process, it has been decided to delegate more powers to the Authorised Dealer Category – I banks (AD banks) in the following areas:

## **1. Direct Dispatch of Shipping Documents**

1.1 In terms of Paragraph 2 of A. P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 6 [dated August 13, 2008,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4415&Mode=0) AD banks have been allowed to regularise cases of dispatch of shipping documents by the exporter direct to the consignee or his agent resident in the country of the final destination of goods, up to USD 1 million or its equivalent per export shipment.

1.2 With a view to simplify the procedure, it has been decided to do away with the limit of USD 1 million per export shipment.

1.3 Accordingly, AD banks may regularize such direct dispatch of shipping documents irrespective of the value of export shipment, subject to following conditions:

a) The export proceeds have been realized in full except for the amount written off, if any, in accordance with the extant provisions for write off.

b) The exporter is a regular customer of AD bank for a period of at least six months.

c) The exporter's account with the AD bank is fully compliant with Reserve Bank's extant KYC / AML guidelines.

To provide greater flexibility to the AD banks and to reduce the time taken for according such approvals, the extant procedure is revised as under:

| Particulars                                                              | Limit | Limit (%) In relation to                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Self-write-off by an exporter<br>(Other than the Status Holder Exporter) | 5%    | Total<br>export<br>proceeds<br>realized<br>during<br>the<br>calendar year preceding<br>the year in which the<br>write-off is being done |
| Self-write-off by Status Holder<br>Exporter                              | 10%   |                                                                                                                                         |
| Write-off by AD Category-1 Bank                                          | 10%   |                                                                                                                                         |

2.2 The above limits of self-write-off and write-off by the AD bank shall be reckoned cumulatively and shall be available subject to the following conditions:

a) The relevant amount has remained outstanding for more than one year;

b) Satisfactory documentary evidence is furnished indicating that the exporter had made all efforts to realise the export proceeds;

c) The exporter is a regular customer of the bank for a period of at least 6 months, is fully compliant with KYC/AML guidelines and AD Bank is satisfied with the bonafides of the transaction.

d) The case falls under any of the undernoted categories:

i) The overseas buyer has been declared insolvent and a certificate from the official liquidator, indicating that there is no possibility of recovery of export proceeds, has been produced.

ii) The unrealized amount represents the balance due in a case settled through the intervention of the Indian Embassy, Foreign Chamber of Commerce or similar Organization;

iii) The goods exported have been auctioned or destroyed by the Port / Customs / Health authorities in the importing country;

iv) The overseas buyer is not traceable over a reasonably long period of time.

v) The unrealized amount represents the undrawn balance of an export bill (not exceeding 10% of the invoice value) remaining outstanding that turned out to be unrealizable despite all efforts made by the exporter;

vi) The cost of resorting to legal action would be disproportionate to the unrealized amount of the export bill or where the exporter even after winning the Court case against the overseas buyer could not execute the Court decree due to reasons beyond his control;

vii) Bills were drawn for the difference between the letter of credit value and actual export value or between the provisional and the actual freight charges but the amounts have remained unrealized consequent to dishonor of the bills by the overseas buyer with no prospects of realization.

2.3 Notwithstanding anything contained in para 2.1 and 2.2 above, the AD bank may, on request of the exporter, write-off unrealised export bills without any limit in respect of cases falling under any of the categories specified at 2.2 (d) (i), (ii) and (iii) above provided AD bank is satisfied with the documentary evidence produced.

2.4 AD banks may also permit write-off of outstanding amount of export bills up to the specified ceilings indicated in para 2.1 above, where the documents have been directly dispatched by the exporter to the consignee or his agent resident in the country of final destination of goods if the case falls under any of the categories specified at 2.2 (d) (i), (ii) and (iii) above.

2.5 The AD bank shall ensure that the exporter seeking write-off has submitted documentary evidence towards surrendering of proportionate export incentives, if any, availed of in respect of the relative export bill.

2.6 In case of self-write off, the AD bank shall obtain from the exporter, a certificate from Chartered Accountant indicating the export realization in the preceding calendar year and details of the amount of write-off, if any, already availed of during the current calendar year along with the requisite details of the EDF/Export Bill under the write-off request. The certificate shall also indicate that the export incentives, if any, availed by the exporter have been surrendered.

2.7 The following cases, however, would not qualify for the "write-off" facility:

- a. Exports made to countries with externalization problem i.e. where the overseas buyer has deposited the value of export in local currency but the amount has not been allowed to be repatriated by the Central Bank authorities of the country concerned.
- b. EDF/Softex which are under investigation by agencies like, Enforcement Directorate, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, etc. as also the outstanding bills which are subject matter of civil / criminal suit.

2.8 AD banks shall report write-off of export bills in Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS).

2.9 AD banks shall put in place a system to carry out random check / percentage check of the export bills so written-off by their internal Inspectors/Auditors (including external Auditors).

2.10 Requests of write-off not covered under the above instructions may be referred to the Regional Office concerned of the Reserve Bank.

### **3. Set-off of Export receivables against Import payables**

3.1 Presently, AD banks are allowing exporters/importers to set-off their outstanding export receivables against outstanding import payables from/to the same overseas buyer/supplier. The Bank has been receiving requests from AD banks, on behalf of their Importer/Exporter constituents, for allowing such set-off with their overseas group/associate companies either on net basis or gross basis, through an in-house or outsourced centralised settlement arrangement.

3.2 Accordingly, it has been decided to delegate powers to AD banks to also consider such requests of set-off, and the revised guidelines, in supersession of the instructions contained in circular [A.P. \(DIR Series\) Circular No 47 dated November 17, 2011,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6822&Mode=0) are issued as under:

- f) Set-off of export receivables against goods shall not be allowed against import payables for services and vice versa.
- g) AD bank shall ensure that import payables/export receivables are outstanding at the time of allowing set-off. Further, set-off shall be allowed between the export and import legs taking place during the same calendar year.
- h) In case of bilateral settlement, the set-off shall be in respect of same overseas buyer/supplier subject to it being supported by verifiable agreement/mutual consent.
- i) In case of settlement within the group/associates companies, the arrangement shall be backed by a written, legally enforceable agreement/contract. AD bank shall ensure that the terms of agreement are strictly adhered to;

4.2 There have been instances when re-importing of goods has not been possible as the exported goods had reportedly been auctioned or destroyed in the importing country.
