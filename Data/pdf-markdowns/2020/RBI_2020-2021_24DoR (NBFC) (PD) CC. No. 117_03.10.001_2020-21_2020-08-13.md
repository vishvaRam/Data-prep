All Core Investment Companies (CICs)

Madam/Dear Sir,

#### **Review of Guidelines for Core Investment Companies**

Please refer to the report of the Working Group (WG) to Review the Regulatory and Supervisory Framework for Core Investment Companies (CICs), constituted under the Chairmanship of Shri Tapan Ray, former Secretary, Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The [report](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=48570) of the WG was placed in public domain in November 2019 seeking comments from the stakeholders. Based on the recommendations of the WG and inputs received from stakeholders, it has been decided to revise the guidelines applicable for Core Investment Companies.

#### **2. Definition of Adjusted Net worth (ANW)**

2.1 Reference is drawn to para 3 (i) of the [Master Direction on Core Investment Companies](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10564) [\(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2016.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10564) While computing Adjusted Net Worth (ANW), the amount representing any direct or indirect capital contribution made by one CIC in another CIC, to the extent such amount exceeds ten per cent of Owned Funds of the investing CIC, shall be deducted. All other terms and conditions for computation of ANW remain the same.

2.2 The deduction requirement shall take immediate effect for any investment made by a CIC in another CIC after date of issue of this circular. In cases where the investment by a CIC in another CIC is already in excess of 10 percent as on the date of this circular, the CIC need not deduct the excess investment as on the date of this circular from owned funds for computation of its ANW till March 31, 2023.

#### **3. Group Structure**

3.1 To address the complexity in group structures and existence of multiple CICs within a group, it has been decided that the number of layers of CICs within a Group (including the parent CIC) shall be restricted to two, irrespective of the extent of direct or indirect holding/ control exercised by a CIC in the other CIC. If a CIC makes any direct/ indirect equity investment in another CIC, it will be deemed as a layer for the investing CIC. While the
