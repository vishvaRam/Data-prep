**(**DPSS.CO.PD.No.503/02.12.004/2020-21 dated October 22, 2020)

#### **1. Introduction**

- 1.1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as the regulator of payment and settlement systems in the country, sets the necessary regulatory framework, through a consultative process, to ensure that different types of payment systems operate in the country to meet the various payment needs in the economy. Over time, a bouquet of payment instruments has evolved to meet the expectations of different segments of users.
- 1.2. As the payment ecosystem matures and the number of payments systems proliferate, it becomes necessary, in the interest of optimal use of regulatory resources, that the payments industry develops standards in respect of system security, pricing practices, customer protection measures, grievance redressal mechanisms, etc. While self-regulation would release regulatory resources that can be better focused on issues of systemic importance, it would, by virtue of being developed by the industry itself, be more appropriate and encourage better compliance. As the industry is forced to think in terms of developing systems that conform to best international practices, it would enhance global competitiveness.
- 1.3. It has, therefore, been decided to encourage the establishment of a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) for Payment Systems Operators (PSOs).
- 1.4. An SRO is a non-governmental organisation that sets and enforces rules and standards relating to the conduct of member entities in the industry, with the aim of protecting the customer and promoting ethical and professional standards. The SRO is expected to resolve disputes among its members internally through mutually accepted processes to ensure that members operate in a disciplined environment and even accept penal actions by the SRO. An ideal SRO would function beyond the narrow self-interests of the industry and address larger concerns, such as protecting customers, furthering training and education and strive for development of members, the industry and the ecosystem as a whole.

<span id="page-1-1"></span> <sup>1</sup> 'Payment System' as defined under 2(i) of Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007; Operators include System Participants and System Providers as defined under Section 2(p) and 2(q) of the Act.

1.5. Regulations, standards, dispute resolution and enforcement by an SRO get legitimacy not just by mutual agreement of its members, but also by the efficiency with which selfregulation is perceived to be administered. Such regulations supplement, but do not replace, applicable laws or regulations.

# **2. Characteristics of an SRO**

- 2.1. An SRO is expected to have the following characteristics in order to gain the trust and confidence of its members:
	- Authority, derived from membership agreements, to set behavioural and professional standards and enforce them on the members;
	- Objective and well-defined processes to make rules and enforce them among members;
	- Standardised procedures for handling conflicts and disputes, as well as methods to resolve them through a transparent and consistent dispute resolution mechanism;
	- Effective means of oversight over its members and ensuring that they adhere to the rules and regulations of the industry as also mutually accepted ethical and professional standards of behaviour; and
	- Develop surveillance methods for effective monitoring.

# **3. Eligibility for Recognition of an SRO by RBI**
