All Scheduled Banks

Dear Sir / Madam

**Section 42(1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 - Change in Minimum Daily Maintenance of the Cash Reserve Requirement**

Please refer to our [circular DOR.No.Ret.BC.51/12.01.001/2019-20 dated March 27, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11840&Mode=0) on the captioned subject.

2. As announced in the [Statement of Developmental and Regulatory Policies of March 27,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582)  [2020,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582) the minimum daily maintenance of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) was reduced from 90 per cent of the prescribed CRR to 80 per cent effective the fortnight beginning March 28, 2020 till June 26, 2020.

3. Keeping in view the continuing of hardships faced by banks in terms of social distancing of staff and consequent strains on reporting requirements, it has now been decided to extend the relaxation of the minimum daily maintenance of the Cash Reserve Ratio of 80 per cent for a further period of three months, *i.e.,* up to September 25, 2020.

Yours faithfully

(Dr. S K Kar) Chief General Manager
