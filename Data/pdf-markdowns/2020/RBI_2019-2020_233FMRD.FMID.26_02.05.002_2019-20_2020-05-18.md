4. RBI has mandated that all OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and credit derivative transactions, both inter-bank and client, will be reported to CCIL's trade reporting platform.

Accordingly, it has been decided that IBUs shall report all OTC foreign exchange, interest rate and credit derivative transactions - both interbank and client transactions - undertaken by them to CCIL's reporting platform with effect from June 1, 2020. Additionally, as a one-time measure to ensure completeness of data, all matured and outstanding transactions as on May 31, 2020, shall be reported by July 31, 2020.

5. The Clearing Corporation of India (CCIL) shall communicate the methodology of such reporting to its members.
