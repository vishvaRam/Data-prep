Madam / Dear Sir,

#### **COVID-19 – Regulatory Package**

Please refer to the [Statement of Development and Regulatory Policies released on](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582)  [March 27, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=49582) where inter alia certain regulatory measures were announced to mitigate the burden of debt servicing brought about by disruptions on account of COVID-19 pandemic and to ensure the continuity of viable businesses. In this regard, the detailed instructions are as follows:

#### **(i) Rescheduling of Payments – Term Loans and Working Capital Facilities**

2. In respect of all term loans (including agricultural term loans, retail and crop loans), all commercial banks (including regional rural banks, small finance banks and local area banks), co-operative banks, all-India Financial Institutions, and NBFCs (including housing finance companies) ("lending institutions") are permitted to grant a moratorium of three months on payment of all instalments[1](#page-0-0) falling due between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020. The repayment schedule for such loans as also the residual tenor, will be shifted across the board by three months after the moratorium period. Interest shall continue to accrue on the outstanding portion of the term loans during the moratorium period.

<span id="page-0-0"></span> <sup>1</sup> Instalments will include the following payments falling due from March 1, 2020 to May 31, 2020: (i) principal and/or interest components; (ii) bullet repayments; (iii) Equated Monthly instalments; (iv) credit card dues.

3. In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of cash credit/overdraft ("CC/OD"), lending institutions are permitted to defer the recovery of interest applied in respect of all such facilities during the period from March 1, 2020 upto May 31, 2020 ("deferment"). The accumulated accrued interest shall be recovered immediately after the completion of this period.

### **(ii) Easing of Working Capital Financing**

4. In respect of working capital facilities sanctioned in the form of CC/OD to borrowers facing stress on account of the economic fallout of the pandemic, lending institutions may recalculate the 'drawing power' by reducing the margins and/or by reassessing the working capital cycle. This relief shall be available in respect of all such changes effected up to May 31, 2020 and shall be contingent on the lending institutions satisfying themselves that the same is necessitated on account of the economic fallout from COVID-19. Further, accounts provided relief under these instructions shall be subject to subsequent supervisory review with regard to their justifiability on account of the economic fallout from COVID-19.

# **Classification as Special Mention Account (SMA) and Non-Performing Asset (NPA)**

5. Since the moratorium/deferment/recalculation of the 'drawing power' is being provided specifically to enable the borrowers to tide over economic fallout from COVID-19, the same will not be treated as concession or change in terms and conditions of loan agreements due to financial difficulty of the borrower under paragraph 2 of the Annex to the Reserve Bank of India (Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets) Directions, 2019 dated June 7, 2019 ("Prudential Framework"). Consequently, such a measure, by itself, shall not result in asset classification downgrade.

6. The asset classification of term loans which are granted relief as per paragraph 2 shall be determined on the basis of revised due dates and the revised repayment schedule. Similarly, working capital facilities where relief is provided as per paragraph 3 above, the SMA and the out of order status shall be evaluated considering the

application of accumulated interest immediately after the completion of the deferment period as well as the revised terms, as permitted in terms of paragraph 4 above.

7. The rescheduling of payments, including interest, will not qualify as a default for the purposes of supervisory reporting and reporting to Credit Information Companies (CICs) by the lending institutions. CICs shall ensure that the actions taken by lending institutions pursuant to the above announcements do not adversely impact the credit history of the beneficiaries.

### **Other Conditions**

8. Lending institutions shall frame Board approved polices for providing the abovementioned reliefs to all eligible borrowers, *inter alia*, including the objective criteria for considering reliefs under paragraph 4 above and disclosed in public domain.

9. Wherever the exposure of a lending institution to a borrower is `5 crore or above as on March 1, 2020, the bank shall develop an MIS on the reliefs provided to its borrowers which shall *inter alia* include borrower-wise and credit-facility wise information regarding the nature and amount of relief granted.

10. The instructions in this circular come into force with immediate effect. The Board of Directors and the key management personnel of the lending institutions shall ensure that the above instructions are properly communicated down the line in their respective organisations, and clear instructions are issued to their staff regarding their implementation.

Yours faithfully,

(Saurav Sinha) Chief General Manager-in-Charge
