## **Framework for Compliance Function and Role of Chief Compliance Officer in Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) under Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories[4](#page--1-1)**

# **1. Introduction**

The Compliance Function is an integral part of effective governance, along with the internal control and risk management processes. The UCBs under Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories shall treat the guidelines in the Circular as a set of minimum guidelines only and accordingly frame their own guidelines taking into account their corporate governance framework, the scale of operations, risk profile, organisational structure and code of conduct, etc.

## **2. Compliance Risk**

Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or loss of reputation a UCB may suffer, as a result of its failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, and codes of conduct, etc., applicable to its activities.

# **3. Scope and Coverage of Compliance Function**

Compliance Function shall ensure strict observance of all statutory and regulatory requirements for the UCB, including standards of conduct, managing conflict of interest, treating customers fairly and ensuring the suitability of customer service.

# **4. Responsibility of the Board and Senior Management**

4.1 The Board / Board Committee[5](#page--1-2) shall ensure that an appropriate Compliance Policy is put in place and implemented. Further, the Board / Board Committee shall prescribe the periodicity for review of Compliance risk.
