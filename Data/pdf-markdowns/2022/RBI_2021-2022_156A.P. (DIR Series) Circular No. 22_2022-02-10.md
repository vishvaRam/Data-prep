#### *Annex*

#### **'Voluntary Retention Route' (VRR) for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) investment**

#### **Introduction**

The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government of India and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), introduces a separate channel, called the 'Voluntary Retention Route' (VRR), to enable FPIs to invest in debt markets in India. Broadly, investments through the Route will be free of the macro-prudential and other regulatory norms applicable to FPI investments in debt markets, provided FPIs voluntarily commit to retain a required minimum percentage of their investments in India for a period. Participation through this Route will be entirely voluntary. The features of the Route are explained below in detail.

#### **2. Definitions**

- i. 'Committed Portfolio Size' (CPS), for an FPI, shall mean the amount allotted to that FPI.
- ii. 'General Investment Limit', for any one of the three categories, viz., Central Government Securities, State Development Loans or Corporate Debt Instruments, shall mean FPI investment limits announced for these categories under the Medium Term Framework, in terms of [A.P. \(DIR Series\) Circular No. 22 dated April 6, 2018,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11241&Mode=0) as modified from time to time.
- iii. 'Minor violations' shall mean violations that are, in the considered opinion of the custodians, unintentional, temporary in nature or have occurred on account of reasons beyond the control of FPIs, and in all cases are corrected on detection.
- iv. 'Related FPIs' shall mean 'investor group' as defined in Regulation 23(3) of SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014.
- v. 'Repo' shall have the same meaning as defined in Section 45U (c) of RBI Act, 1934; and for the purpose of this regulation excludes repo conducted under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility and the Marginal Standing Facility.
- vi. 'Retention Period' shall mean the time period that an FPI voluntarily commits for retaining the CPS in India.
- vii. 'Reverse Repo' shall have the same meaning as defined in Section 45U (d) of RBI Act, 1934; and for the purpose of this regulation excludes reverse repo conducted under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility and the Marginal Standing Facility.

- b. Prior to the end of the committed retention period, an FPI, if it so desires, may opt to continue investments under this Route for an additional identical retention period. In that case, it shall convey this decision to its custodian.
- c. In case an FPI decides not to continue under VRR at the end of the retention period, it may: (a) liquidate its portfolio and exit, or (b) shift its investments to the 'General Investment Limit', subject to availability of limit under the 'General Investment Limit', or (c) hold its investments until its date of maturity or until it is sold, whichever is earlier.
