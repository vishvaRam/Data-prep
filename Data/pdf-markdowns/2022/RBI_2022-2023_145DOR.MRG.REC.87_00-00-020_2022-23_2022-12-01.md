As you are aware, Reserve Bank had vide [circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.89](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4676&Mode=0)  [/21.04.141/2008-09 dated December 1, 2008](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4676&Mode=0) and [circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8874&Mode=0)  [DBOD.No.BP.BC.111/21.04.157/2013-14 dated May 12, 2014](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8874&Mode=0) issued instructions to Indian banks and AIFIs on the issue of dealing in financial products by their branches/subsidiaries operating outside India.
