A reference is invited to para 3.2.3 (j) of the [Reserve Bank's Circular Ref.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0)  [DOR.CRE.REC.No.60/03.10.001/2021-22 dated October 22, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0) on 'Scale Based Regulation (SBR): A Revised Regulatory Framework for NBFCs' in terms of which NBFCs with 10 and more branches are mandated to adopt Core Banking Solution.

2. Accordingly, it has been decided that NBFCs – Middle Layer and NBFCs - Upper Layer with 10 and more 'Fixed point service delivery units'[1](#page-0-0) as on October 1, 2022 shall be mandatorily required to implement 'Core Financial Services Solution (CFSS)', akin to the Core Banking Solution (CBS) adopted by banks. The CFSS shall provide for seamless customer interface in digital offerings and transactions relating to products and services with anywhere / anytime facility, enable integration of NBFCs' functions, provide centralised database and accounting records, and be able to generate suitable MIS, both for internal purposes and regulatory reporting.

3. The timeframe for implementation of the requirement as indicated in Para 2 above shall be as under:

```

<span id="page-0-0"></span><sup>1</sup> For the purpose of this Circular, a 'Fixed point service delivery unit' is a place of operation from where the business activity of non-banking financial intermediation is carried out by the NBFC and which is manned either by its own staff or outsourced agents. It carries uniform signage with name of the NBFC and functions under administrative control of the NBFC. Administrative Offices and Back Offices which do not have any direct interface with customers should not be treated as a 'Fixed point service delivery unit'.
