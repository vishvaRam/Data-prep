lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and Private Sector Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi-urban branches only), Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and computerized Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) which have been ceded with Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs), on use of their own resources. This interest subvention of 2% per annum will be calculated on the loan amount from the date of disbursement/drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the loan by the farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year. The applicable lending rate to farmers and the rate of interest subvention for the financial year 2021-22 will be as follows:

| Financial<br>Year | Lending rate to farmers | Rate for Interest<br>Subvention |
|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 2021-22           | 7%                      | 2%                              |

- (ii) An additional interest subvention of 3% per annum will be provided to such of those farmers repaying in time, i.e., from the date of disbursement of the loan/s upto the actual date of repayment or upto the due date fixed by the banks for repayment of such loan/s, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies that the farmers repaying promptly as above would get short term crop loans and / or short term loans for allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. @ 4% per annum during the financial year 2021-22.
- (iii) Interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits on short term crop loans and short term loans for allied activities will be available on an overall limit of ₹3 lakh per annum subject to a maximum sub-limit of ₹2 lakh per farmer in respect of those farmers involved only in activities related to animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. The limit for crop loan component will take priority for interest subvention and prompt repayment incentive benefits and the residual amount will be considered towards allied activities including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, bee keeping etc. subject to the cap as mentioned above. **[\(Illustrations\)](#page--1-0)**
- (iv) In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention under KCC will be available to small and marginal farmers for a further period of upto six months post the harvest of the crop against negotiable warehouse receipts on the produce stored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA), at the same rate as applicable to the agri. loan.
- (v) With a view to providing relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, the interest subvention of 2% per annum will be made available to banks as stated in the table given in para 2(i) above, for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards.
- (vi) However, in case of severe natural calamities, the interest subvention of 2% per annum will be made available to banks for the first three years /entire period (subject to a maximum of five years) on the restructured loan amount. Further, in all such cases, the benefit of prompt repayment incentive @ 3% per annum shall also be provided to the affected farmers. The grant of such benefits in cases of severe natural calamities shall, however, be decided by a High Level Committee (HLC) based on the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Central Team (IMCT) and Sub Committee of National Executive Committee (SC-NEC).
- (vii) To ensure hassle-free benefits to farmers under the ISS, Aadhar linkage would continue to be mandatory for availing the above mentioned short term loans in 2021-22.
- (viii) All the above mentioned short term loans processed in 2021-22 are required to be brought on the ISS portal / DBT platform. Banks are advised to capture and submit category-wise data of beneficiaries under the Scheme and report the same on the ISS portal, individual farmer-wise, to settle the audited claims arising from 2021-22 onwards.

3. All lending banks may submit their eligible pending audited claims of previous scheme years as well as for 2021-22, if any, to us latest by June 30, 2022.

4. Further, banks are advised to adhere to the following stipulations:

- (i) In respect of interest subvention, banks are required to submit their claims on annual basis duly certified by their Statutory Auditors as true and correct, within a quarter from the close of the year.
