## **3. Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) – expansion in scope of permitted activities**

At present, Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs) are permitted to undertake foreign currency business for limited purposes. With a view to strengthen the role of SPDs as market makers, on a par with banks operating primary dealer business, it is proposed to enable SPDs to offer all foreign exchange market-making facilities as currently permitted to Category-I Authorised Dealers, subject to prudential guidelines. This measure would give forex customers a broader spectrum of marketmakers in managing their currency risk, thereby adding breadth to the forex market in India. Wider market presence would improve the ability of SPDs to provide support to the primary issuance and secondary market activities in government securities, which would continue to be the major focus of primary dealer activities. Regulations in this regard would be issued separately.
