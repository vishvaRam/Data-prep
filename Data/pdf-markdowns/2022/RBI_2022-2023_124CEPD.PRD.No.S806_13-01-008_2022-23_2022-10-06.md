- (f) The IO shall, on a quarterly basis, analyse the pattern of all complaints received against the CIC, such as entity wise, product-wise, category-wise, consumer group-wise, geographical location-wise, etc., and may provide inputs to the CIC for policy intervention, if so warranted.

- (c) In case the CIC has a complaint management software, it shall provide the IO 'read-only' access to the system and enable uploading of the decisions of the IO.
- (d) The IO shall also have 'read-only' access to the Reserve Bank's Complaint Management System to enable the IO to keep track of: (i) the cases forwarded by the offices of RBI Ombudsmen, (ii) decisions of the RBI Ombudsmen, and (iii) where applicable, the decision of the Appellate Authority under the RBI Ombudsman scheme.

- (g) Where the IO overrules the decision of the CIC to reject or partly reject the complaint, the CIC can disagree with the decision of the IO only with the approval of its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer. In such cases, the reply to the complainant shall explicitly state the fact that the complaint was examined by the IO and the decision of the CIC was overruled by the IO in favour of the complainant; however, the CIC, with the approval of its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, has disagreed with the decision of the IO. Such decision must be communicated to the complainant within 7 days of communication of the decision of the IO on the case to the CIC. All such cases shall be subsequently reviewed on a quarterly basis by the Board of the CIC.

![](_page_4_Picture_0.jpeg)

that he/she can approach the RBI Ombudsman for redress (provided the complaint pertains to a Credit Institution / Regulated Entity that falls under RB-IOS, 2021) along with complete details of the complaint. The advice should include the link to Reserve Bank's portal [\(https://cms.rbi.org.in\)](https://cms.rbi.org.in/) for online filing of complaints.

The IO may also be associated with such trainings, where necessary.
- (j) While assessing the performance of the IO, in addition to the level of pendency etc., the CIC shall also consider the number of cases where substantive differences were observed between the decisions of the IO visà-vis those given by the RBI Ombudsman subsequently.
- (k) The CIC shall disseminate the guidelines/instructions regarding the role of the IO among its staff while communicating the appointment of the IO in the organization (all branches and administrative offices).
- (l) The CIC shall not provide the contact details of the IO in the public domain as the IO shall not handle complaints received directly from complainants.
- (m) The decision of the IO on the respective complaint shall mandatorily be included in the information submitted by the CIC to the office of the RBI Ombudsman while replying to, or furnishing documents to, the office of the RBI Ombudsman.
