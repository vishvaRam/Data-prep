Dear Sir/ Madam,

2. Based on the Committee's recommendations and feedback from the stakeholders, the extant regulatory framework for ARCs has been amended as detailed in the [Annex.](#page--1-0)

3. These guidelines shall be effective immediately or as indicated otherwise in the [Annex.](#page--1-0)

Yours faithfully,

The ARCs shall put in place appropriate measures to ensure succession planning.
- **(iii) Age of the MD/ CEO and WTDs:** No person shall continue as MD/ CEO or WTD beyond the age of 70 years. Within the overall limit of 70 years, as part of their internal policy, ARCs' Boards are free to prescribe a lower retirement age.

# **5. Fit and Proper Criteria for Directors and CEO**

- (i) In terms of the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India is required for appointment/ re-appointment of a director or MD/ CEO. ARCs shall undertake due diligence to determine the suitability of the person for the post, based upon track record, integrity and other 'fit and proper' criteria.

- (ii) The declaration in [Appendix I](#page--1-0) with updated information shall be obtained from the directors/ MD/ CEO on an annual basis, as on March 31 of each year.

### **Section II: Other Measures**

### **8. Settlement of Dues Payable by the Borrowers under One-time Settlement**

(i) Under earlier guidelines[2](#page-4-0), each ARC was required to frame a Board-approved policy laying down the broad parameters for settlement of debts due from the borrowers. Further, the Board was permitted to delegate powers to a committee comprising any

<span id="page-4-0"></span> <sup>2</sup> (a) Every ARC shall frame a policy duly approved by the Board of Directors laying down the broad parameters for settlement of debts due from borrowers; (b) The policy may, inter alia, cover aspects such as cut-off date, formula for computation of realisable amount and settlement of account, payment terms and conditions, and borrower's capability to pay the amount settled; (c) Where the settlement does not envisage payment of the entire amount agreed upon in one instalment, the proposals should be in line with and supported by an acceptable business plan, projected earnings and cash flows of the borrower; (d) The proposal should not materially affect the asset liability management of the ARC or the commitments given to investors; (e) The Board of Directors may delegate powers to a committee comprising any director and/ or any functionaries of the company for taking decisions on proposals for settlement of dues; (f) Deviation from the policy should be made only with the approval of the Board of Directors.

director and/ or any functionaries of the ARC for taking decisions on the proposals for settlement of dues. On a review, the guidelines for the reconstruction of financial assets through settlement of dues payable by the borrowers have been modified as follows:

- a) Settlement of dues with the borrower shall be done only after the proposal is examined by an Independent Advisory Committee (IAC)[3](#page-0-0) which shall consist of professionals having technical/ finance/ legal background. IAC, after assessing the financial position of the borrower, the time frame available for recovery of the dues from the borrower, projected earnings & cash flows of the borrower and other relevant aspects, shall give its recommendations to the ARC regarding settlement of dues with the borrower.
- b) The Board of Directors including at least two independent directors shall deliberate on the recommendations of IAC and consider the various options available for recovery of dues before deciding whether the option of settlement of dues with the borrower is the best option available under the existing circumstances and the decision, along with detailed rationale, shall be specifically recorded in the minutes of the Board meeting.
- c) Settlement with the borrower should be done only after all possible steps to recover the dues have been taken and there are no further prospects of recovering the debt.
- d) The Net Present Value (NPV) of the settlement amount should generally be not less than the realizable value of securities. If there is a significant variation between the valuation of securities recorded at the time of acquisition of financial assets and the realisable value assessed at the time of entering into a settlement, reasons thereof shall be duly recorded.

<span id="page-0-0"></span> <sup>3</sup> Under extant guidelines, an ARC is required to constitute an IAC for examining the proposals related to change in or takeover of management of business of the borrower. This IAC shall also now examine the proposals of settlement of dues with the borrower.

- e) The settlement amount should preferably be paid in lump sum. In cases where the borrower is unable to pay the entire amount in lump sum, IAC shall make specific recommendations about minimum upfront lump-sum payment and maximum repayment period.
- f) ARCs shall frame a Board-approved policy based on the above-mentioned framework.
- (ii) Instructions given under paragraph 2(B)[4](#page-1-0) of the [circular DNBS.\(PD\).CC.No.37/ SCRC/](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8776&Mode=0)  [26.03.001/ 2013-2014](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8776&Mode=0) dated March 19, 2014 on 'Buyback of assets from ARCs by the defaulters and acquisition of assets by ARCs from sponsor banks' are hereby withdrawn and ARCs shall ensure compliance with Section 29A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 in dealing with the prospective buyers.

### **9. Policy on Management Fees**

The [circular DOR.NBFC\(ARC\) CC. No. 9/26.03.001/2020-21](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11937&Mode=0) dated July 16, 2020 on Fair Practices Code (FPC) requires ARCs to put in place a Board-approved policy on the management fee, expenses and incentives. In order to ensure that management fee/ incentives charged by ARCs are reasonable and transparent, the following additional measures shall be adopted:

<span id="page-1-0"></span><sup>4</sup> Promoters of the defaulting company/ borrowers or guarantors are allowed to buy back their assets from the ARCs provided the following conditions are met:

I. Such a settlement is considered helpful in (i) minimizing or eliminating the cost of litigation and the attendant loss of time;(ii) arresting the negative impact of diminution in the value of secured assets which are likely to rapidly lose value once a unit becomes non-operational;(iii) where the recovery/ resolution process would appear to be rather uncertain; and iv) where such settlement will be beneficial for restructuring purposes.

II. The valuation of the asset is worked out by the ARCs after factoring in the following components: The current value of the proposed settlement (valuation of the asset not more than six months old) vis-à-vis the net present value of the recoveries under the alternative mode of resolution taking into consideration the timelines involved therein; Likely positive or negative changes in the value of the secured asset on account of passage of time; Likely diminution in realisation due to accumulation of statutory dues, liability to employees, etc.; Other factors, if any, which may affect recoveries.

III. ARCs shall frame a Policy duly approved by the Board of Directors, which should include the above aspects besides those already contained in clause 7 (5) of the ARC (Reserve Bank) Guidelines and Directions, 2003, as updated from time to time.

- (i) Any management fee/ incentives charged towards the asset reconstruction or securitisation activity shall come only from the recovery effected from the underlying financial assets.
- (ii) The Board-approved policy shall indicate the quantitative cap/ limit on the management fee/ incentives under various scenarios, any deviation from which shall require approval of the Board.

## **10. Minimum Net Owned Fund (NOF) Requirement**

The minimum NOF (as required under para 4 of the [circular DNBR. PD \(ARC\) CC. No.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10949&Mode=0)  [03/26.03.001/2016-17](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10949&Mode=0) dated April 28, 2017 on Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002- Section 3(1)(b) - Requirement of NOF for ARCs) is hereby increased to ₹300 crore on an ongoing basis from the existing requirement of ₹100 crore. Consequently, any ARC obtaining the certificate of registration on or after the date of this circular shall not commence the business of securitisation or asset reconstruction without having minimum NOF of ₹300 crore. The following glide path is provided for the existing ARCs to achieve the minimum required NOF of ₹300 crore:

| Current Minimum NOF | By March 31, 2024 | By March 31, 2026 |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ₹100 crore          | ₹200 crore        | ₹300 crore        |

In case of non-compliance at any of the above stages, the non-complying ARC shall be subject to supervisory action, including prohibition on undertaking incremental business till it reaches the required minimum NOF applicable at that time.

#### **11. Deployment of Surplus Funds**

Para (e) of the [circular DNBS\(PD\) CC.No.18/SCRC/26.03.001/2009-2010 dated April 21,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5614&Mode=0)  [2010](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5614&Mode=0) on the subject has been amended. In order to allow ARCs to manage their surplus funds efficiently, in addition to the avenues already permitted, they are now permitted to deploy the available surplus funds in short-term instruments viz., money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit and corporate bonds/ commercial papers which have a shortterm rating equivalent to the long-term rating of AA- or above by an eligible CRA, subject to the following conditions:

- (i) Maximum investment in such instruments is capped at 10% of the NOF of the ARC.
- (ii) The ARC shall have a Board-approved policy in this regard.

### **12. Investment in SRs issued by the ARCs**

Henceforth, ARCs shall, by transferring funds, invest in the SRs at a minimum of either 15% of the transferors' investment in the SRs or 2.5% of the total SRs issued, whichever is higher, of each class of SRs issued by them under each scheme on an ongoing basis till the redemption of all the SRs issued under such scheme.

# **13. Allowing ARCs to act as Resolution Applicant under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC)**

ARCs are currently not permitted to commence or carry on any business other than that of securitisation or asset reconstruction or the business referred to in Section 10(1) of the SARFAESI Act without prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India. It has now been decided under the provision of Section 10(2) of the SARFAESI Act to permit ARCs to undertake those activities as a Resolution Applicant (RA) under IBC which are not specifically allowed under the SARFAESI Act. This permission shall be subject to the following conditions:

- (i) The ARC has a minimum NOF of ₹1,000 crore.

#### **14. Transfer of Stressed Loans to ARCs**

Subject to the provisions of the [circulars DNBR.PD \(ARC\) CC.No.07/26.03.001/2018-19](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11608&Mode=0) [dated June 28,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11608&Mode=0) 2019 and [DOR.NBFC\(ARC\) CC.
