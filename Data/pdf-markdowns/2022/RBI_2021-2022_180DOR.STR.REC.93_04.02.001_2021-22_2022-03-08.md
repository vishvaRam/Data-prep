2. Government of India has approved the extension of Interest Equalization Scheme for Pre and Post Shipment Rupee Export Credit ('Scheme') up to March 31, 2024 or till further review, whichever is earlier. The extension takes effect from October 1, 2021 and ends on March 31, 2024. The modifications made by the Government to the Scheme are detailed below:

2.1 'Telecom Instruments' sector having six HS lines[1](#page-0-0) shall be out of the purview of the Scheme, except for MSME manufacturer exporters.

2.2 Revised interest equalisation rates under the Scheme will now be 3 per cent for MSME manufacturer exporters exporting under any HS lines, and 2 per cent for manufacturer exporters and merchant exporters exporting under 410 HS lines (after excluding 6 HS lines pertaining to Telecom Sector as mentioned above).

2.3 Banks, while issuing approval to the exporter, will necessarily furnish i) the prevailing interest rate, ii) the interest subvention being provided, and iii) the net rate being charged to each exporter, so as to ensure transparency and greater accountability in the operation of the Scheme.

Caution: RBI never sends mails, SMSs or makes calls asking for personal information like bank account details, passwords, etc. It never keeps or offers funds to anyone. Please do not respond in any manner to such offers.
