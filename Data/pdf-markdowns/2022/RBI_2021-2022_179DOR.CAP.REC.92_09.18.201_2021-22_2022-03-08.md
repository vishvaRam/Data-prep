5. The guidelines governing the instruments specified in para 4 (I) &(II) above, indicating the regulatory requirements, are enclosed in [Annexes](#page--1-0) I & [II](#page--1-1) respectively.

6. For the purpose of enhancing investor education on the risk characteristics of regulatory capital requirements, UCBs, which issue regulatory capital instruments as specified in para 4 above, shall adhere to the following conditions:

a) For floating rate instruments, banks should not use its Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark.

b) A specific sign-off as quoted below, from the investors, for having understood the features and risks of the instruments, may be incorporated in the common application form of the proposed issue:

"By making this application, I / we acknowledge that I / we have understood the terms and conditions of the issue of [Name of the share/security] being issued by [Name of the bank] as disclosed in the Prospectus and Offer Document".

c) UCBs shall ensure that all the publicity material / offer document, application form and other communication with the investor should clearly state in bold letters (Arial font, size 14, equivalent size in English / Vernacular version) how a PNCPS / PCPS / RNCPS / RCPS / PDI / LTSB, as the case may be, is different from a fixed deposit, and that these instruments are not covered by deposit insurance.

d) The procedure for transfer to legal heirs in the event of death of the subscriber of the instrument should also be specified.

# **Refund of share capital**

7. In terms of Section 12 (2) (ii) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, a co-operative bank shall not withdraw or reduce its share capital, except to the extent and subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf. Accordingly, it has been decided to permit UCBs to refund the share capital to their members, or nominees / heirs of deceased members, on demand, subject to the following conditions:

a) The bank's capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) is 9 percent or above, both as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection.

![](_page_2_Picture_0.jpeg)

b) Such refund does not result in the CRAR of the bank falling below regulatory minimum of 9 per cent.

8. It is clarified that for the purpose of computing CRAR as above, accretion to capital funds after the balance sheet date[1,](#page-2-0) other than by way of profits, may be taken into account. Any reduction in capital funds, including by way of losses, during the aforesaid period shall also be considered.

### **Share linking to borrowing norms**

9. Borrowings from UCBs are linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members as below:

- i. 5 per cent of the borrowings, if the borrowings are on unsecured basis.
- ii. 2.5 per cent of the borrowings, in case of secured borrowings.
- iii. In case of secured borrowings by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE), 2.5 per cent of the borrowings; of which 1 per cent is to be collected initially and the balance of 1.5 per cent is to be collected in the course of next 2 years.

10. The above share linking norm may be applicable for member's shareholdings up to the limit of 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank. Where a member is already holding 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of a UCB, it would not be necessary for him / her to subscribe to any additional share capital on account of the application of extant share linking norms. In other words, a borrowing member may be required to hold shares for an amount that may be computed as per the extant share linking norms or for an amount that is 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank, whichever is lower.

11. In terms of the extant norms[2](#page-2-1), UCBs which maintain CRAR of 12 per cent on a continuous basis, are exempted from the mandatory share linking norms outlined in para 9 above. On a review, it has been decided that the share-linking to borrowing norms shall be discretionary for UCBs which meet the minimum regulatory CRAR criteria of 9 per cent and a Tier 1 CRAR of 5.5 per cent as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection. Such UCBs shall have a Board-approved policy on sharelinking to borrowing norms, which shall be implemented in a transparent, consistent and nondiscriminatory manner. The policy may be reviewed by the Board at the beginning of the accounting year. UCBs which do not maintain the minimum CRAR of 9 percent and Tier 1

 <sup>1</sup> *Capital funds shall be as per audited data* 

<span id="page-2-1"></span><span id="page-2-0"></span>*<sup>2</sup> Please refer [circular UBD.BPD.\(PCB\).Cir.No.22/09.18.201/2010-11 dated November 15, 2010](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6101&Mode=0) on Share Linking to Borrowing Norm in Urban Co-operative Banks*

![](_page_3_Picture_0.jpeg)

CRAR of 5.5 per cent, shall continue to be guided by the norms on share-linking to borrowing as specified in paragraph 9 above.

12. Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preference Shares (PNCPS) held by members / subscribers, may be treated as shares for the purpose of compliance with the extant share linking to borrowing norms.

# **Repeal**

13. The list of circulars, that stand repealed fully or partially, is furnished in [Appendix](#page--1-0) to the circular.

# **Effective Date**

14.These instructions shall come into force with immediate effect.

Yours faithfully

- b) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of Department of Regulation (DoR), RBI. While considering the proposals received from banks for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank's CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option.

# **2.6 Classification in the Balance Sheet**

These instruments will be classified as 'Borrowings' and shown separately in the Balance Sheet.

# **2.7 Interest Rate**

LTSB may bear a fixed rate of interest or a floating rate of interest referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.

# **2.8 Redemption / Repayment**

Redemption / repayment at maturity shall be made only with the prior approval of the DoR RBI.

# **2.9 Seniority of Claims**

LTSB will be subordinated to the claims of depositors and other creditors but would rank senior to the claims of investors in instruments eligible for inclusion in Tier-I capital and holders of preference shares (both Tier I & Tier II). Among investors of instruments included in Lower Tier-II capital (i.e. including outstanding LTDs, if any), the claims shall rank pari passu with each other.

### **2.10 Progressive Discount**

These Bonds shall be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes in the last five years of their tenor, as under:

| Remaining Maturity of Instruments             | Rate of Discount (%) |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Less than one year                            | 100                  |
| One year and more but less than two years     | 80                   |
| Two years and more but less than three years  | 60                   |
| Three years and more but less than four years | 40                   |
| Four years and more but less than five years  | 20                   |

### **2.11 Other conditions**

2.11.1 LTSB shall be fully paid-up, unsecured, and free of any restrictive clauses.

2.11.2 UCBs shall also comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the LTSB, provided they are not in conflict with the terms and conditions specified in these guidelines. Any instance of conflict shall be brought to the notice of the DoR of RBI for seeking confirmation of the eligibility of the instrument for inclusion in Tier-II capital.

## **2.12 Reserve Requirement**

The total amount raised through the issue of LTSB shall be reckoned as liability for the calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will attract CRR / SLR requirements. The amount collected by the UCB from members / prospective investors and held by it pending issue of LTSB, shall not be reckoned for calculation of capital funds.

## **2.13 Reporting Requirements**

UCBs issuing LTSB shall submit a report to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI giving details of the amount raised, including the terms and conditions of issue together with a copy of Prospectus / Offer Document, soon after the issue is completed.

## **2.14 Investments in LTSB and advances for purchase of LTSB**

UCBs shall not grant any loan or advance to any person for purchasing their LTSB or LTSB of other banks. UCBs shall not invest in LTSB issued by other banks nor shall they grant advances against the security of LTSB issued by them or other banks.
