# **Foreign Exchange Management (Overseas Investment) Directions, 2022**

Overseas investments by persons resident in India enhance the scale and scope of business operations of Indian entrepreneurs by providing global opportunities for growth. Such ventures through easier access to technology, research and development, a wider global market and reduced cost of capital along with other benefits increase the competitiveness of Indian entities and boost their brand value. These overseas investments are also important drivers of foreign trade and technology transfer thus boosting domestic employment, investment and growth through such interlinkages.

2. In keeping with the spirit of liberalisation and to promote ease of doing business, the Central Government and the Reserve Bank of India have been progressively simplifying the procedures and rationalising the rules and regulations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. In this direction, a significant step has been taken with operationalisation of a new Overseas Investment regime. [Foreign Exchange Management \(Overseas Investment\) Rules, 2022](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/content/pdfs/GazetteRules23082022.pdf) have been notified by the Central Government vide Notification No. G.S.R. 646(E) dated August 22, 2022 and [Foreign Exchange Management \(Overseas Investment\) Regulations, 2022](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12380&Mode=0) have been notified by the Reserve Bank vide Notification No. FEMA 400/2022-RB dated August 22, 2022 in supersession of the [Notification No. FEMA 120/2004-RB](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=2126&Mode=0) dated July 07, 2004 [Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of any Foreign Security) (Amendment) Regulations, 2004] and [Notification No. FEMA 7 \(R\)/2015-RB dated January 21, 2016](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10257&Mode=0) [Foreign Exchange Management (Acquisition and Transfer of Immovable Property Outside India) Regulations, 2015]. The new regime simplifies the existing framework for overseas investment by persons resident in India to cover wider economic activity and significantly reduces the need for seeking specific approvals. This will reduce the compliance burden and associated compliance costs.

3. Some of the significant changes brought about through the new rules and regulations are summarised below:

- (i) enhanced clarity with respect to various definitions;
- (ii) introduction of the concept of "strategic sector";
- (iii) dispensing with the requirement of approval for:
	- a. deferred payment of consideration;
	- b. investment/disinvestment by persons resident in India under investigation by any investigative agency/regulatory body;
	- c. issuance of corporate guarantees to or on behalf of second or subsequent level step down subsidiary (SDS);
	- d. write-off on account of disinvestment;
- (iv) introduction of "Late Submission Fee (LSF)" for reporting delays.

4. The detailed operational instructions in this regard are given in [Annex-I.](#page--1-0) The instructions contained in these directions shall supersede the instructions contained in the circulars listed in [Annex-II.](#page--1-0)

5. The revised reporting forms and instructions for filling up the forms under the new regime are being provided on Reserve Bank's website in Part VIII of the [Master Direction no. 18 on 'Reporting](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10202)  [under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999' dated January 01, 2016.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10202)

6. AD banks may bring the contents of the circular to the notice of their customers/constituents concerned.

7. The directions contained in this circular have been issued under Section 10(4) and 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and are without prejudice to permissions/ approvals, if any, required under any other law.

Yours faithfully

Ajay Kumar Misra Chief General Manager-in-Charge

#### **Part I - Definitions and associated details**

1. Reference shall be made to OI Rules and OI Regulations for the definitions of the various terms used in these directions. However, the major terms are reiterated and elaborated below:

(i) **"foreign entity"** - the extant concept of Joint Venture (JV) and Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS) is substituted under the new regime with the concept of foreign entity, which means an entity formed or registered or incorporated outside India, including in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in India, that has limited liability. 'Limited liability' would mean a structure such as a limited liability company, limited liability partnership, *etc*. where the liability of the person resident in India is clear and limited. In case of a foreign entity being an investment fund or vehicle, duly regulated by the regulator for the financial sector in the host jurisdiction and set up as a trust outside India, the liability of the person resident in India shall be clear and limited not exceeding the interest or contribution in the fund in any manner. Further, the trustee of such fund shall be a person resident outside India.

(ii) **"strategic sector"** shall include energy and natural resources sectors such as Oil, Gas, Coal, Mineral Ores, submarine cable system and start-ups and any other sector or sub-sector as deemed fit by the Central Government. The restriction of limited liability structure of foreign entity shall not be mandatory for entities with core activity in any strategic sector. Accordingly, Overseas Direct Investment (ODI) can be made in such sectors in unincorporated entities as well. An Indian entity is also permitted to participate in a consortium with other international operators to construct and maintain submarine cable systems on co-ownership basis. AD banks may allow remittances for ODI in strategic sector after ensuring that Indian entity has obtained necessary permission from the competent authority, wherever applicable.

(iii) **"control"** means the right to appoint majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions exercisable by a person or persons acting individually or in concert, directly or indirectly, including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders' agreements or voting agreements that entitle them to ten percent or more of voting rights or in any other manner in the entity.

(iv) **"Indian entity"** – the extant concept of Indian party (IP) where all the investors from India in a foreign entity were together considered as IP, has been substituted under the new regime with the concept of Indian entity where each investor entity shall be separately considered as an Indian entity. Indian entity shall mean a company defined under the Companies Act, 2013 or a body corporate incorporated by any law for the time being in force or a Limited Liability Partnership formed under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2008 or a partnership firm registered under the Indian Partnership Act, 1932.

4

(v) **"subsidiary"/ "step down subsidiary (SDS)"** of a foreign entity means an entity in which the foreign entity has control and the structure of such subsidiary/SDS shall comply with the structural requirements of a foreign entity, *i.e.*, such subsidiary/SDS shall also have limited liability where the foreign entity's core activity is not in strategic sector. The investee entities of the foreign entity where such foreign entity does not have control (as defined above) shall not be treated as SDSs and therefore need not be reported henceforth.

(vi) **"Overseas Direct Investment (ODI)"** means (i) acquisition of any unlisted equity capital or subscription as a part of the Memorandum of Association of a foreign entity, or (ii) investment in 10% or more of the paid-up equity capital of a listed foreign entity, or (iii) investment with control where investment is less than 10% of the paid-up equity capital of a listed foreign entity.

*Explanation*: Once an investment in a foreign entity is classified as ODI, the investment shall continue to be treated as ODI even if such investment falls below 10% of the paid-up equity capital or the investor loses control in the foreign entity.

(vii) **"equity capital"** means equity shares or perpetual capital or instruments that are irredeemable or contribution to non-debt capital of a foreign entity, which is in the nature of fully and compulsorily convertible instruments. Accordingly, any instrument which is redeemable or non-convertible or optionally convertible shall be treated as debt for the purpose of OI Rules/Regulations/Directions.

(viii) **"financial commitment"** by a person resident in India means the aggregate amount of investment by way of ODI, debt other than Overseas Portfolio Investment (OPI) and non-fundbased facility or facilities extended by it to all foreign entities. An Indian entity may lend or invest in any debt instruments issued by a foreign entity or extend non-fund based commitment to or on behalf of a foreign entity, including overseas SDSs of such Indian entity, subject to the following conditions:

- a) the Indian entity is eligible to make ODI;
- b) the Indian entity has made ODI in the foreign entity;
- c) the Indian entity has acquired control in the foreign entity on or before the date of making such financial commitment.

(ix) **"Overseas Portfolio Investment (OPI)"** means investment, other than ODI, in foreign securities. The following is further provided:

- a) OPI shall not be made in:
	- i. any unlisted debt instruments; or
	- ii. any security which is issued by a person resident in India who is not in an IFSC; or
	- iii. any derivatives unless otherwise permitted by Reserve Bank; or
	- iv. any commodities including Bullion Depository Receipts (BDRs).

- b) OPI by a person resident in India in the listed equity capital of a listed entity, even after its delisting, shall continue to be treated as OPI until any further investment is made in the entity, i.e., any further investment made in the equity capital of the foreign entity after its delisting shall be made as ODI.
- c) A listed Indian company may make OPI, including by way of reinvestment, in accordance with schedule II of the OI Rules. 'Reinvestment' means that the OPI proceeds are exempted from repatriation provisions as long as such proceeds are reinvested within the time specified for realisation and repatriation as per Notification No. FEMA 9(R)/2015-RB namely, [Foreign](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10258&Mode=0)  [Exchange Management \(Realisation, repatriation and surrender of foreign exchange\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10258&Mode=0)  [Regulations, 2015.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10258&Mode=0)
- d) An unlisted Indian entity may make OPI in accordance with schedule II of the OI Rules.
- e) The investment (including sponsor contribution) in units of any investment fund overseas, duly regulated by the regulator for the financial sector in the host jurisdiction, shall be considered as OPI. Accordingly, in jurisdictions other than IFSC, listed Indian companies and resident individuals may make such investment. Whereas in IFSC an unlisted Indian entity may also make such OPI in units of an investment fund or vehicle, in terms of schedule V of the OI Rules subject to limits, as applicable.
- f) Resident individuals may make OPI within the overall limit for Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) in terms of schedule III of the OI Rules. Further, shares or interest acquired by the resident individuals by way of sweat equity shares or minimum qualification shares or under Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)/ Employee Benefits Scheme up to 10% of the paidup capital/stock, whether listed or unlisted, of the foreign entity and without control shall also qualify as OPI.
- g) Any investment made overseas in accordance with schedule IV of the OI Rules in securities as stipulated by SEBI by Mutual Funds (MFs), Venture Capital Funds (VCFs) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) registered with SEBI shall be considered as OPI.

(x) **"Listed equity capital or instrument"** - Wherever a reference is made in these directions or OI Rules or OI Regulations to listed equity capital or a listed instrument overseas, it shall mean that such equity capital or instrument, as the case may be, shall be listed on a recognised stock exchange outside India.

## **Part II – General provisions**

## **2. Exemptions from applicability of OI Rules/Regulations/Directions**

The provisions contained in the OI Rules/Regulations/Directions shall not apply, and general permission shall be available for acquisition or transfer of any investment outside India made as per rule 4 of the OI Rules.

#### **3. Permission for making overseas investment**

(1) A person resident in India may make or transfer any investment or financial commitment outside India under general permission/automatic route subject to the provisions contained in the OI Rules, OI Regulations and these directions.

(2) The person intending to make any financial commitment shall fill up the Form FC as provided in the "Master Direction – [Reporting under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999"](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10202) duly supported by the requisite documents and approach the designated AD bank for making the investment/remittance.

(3) In respect of any case under the approval route, the applicant shall approach their designated AD bank who shall forward the proposal to the Reserve Bank after due scrutiny and with its specific recommendations. The application for overseas investment under the approval route would continue to be submitted to the Reserve Bank in physical/electronic form through email as hitherto, in addition to the online reporting.

# **4. Approval from the Central Government**

The applications for overseas investment/financial commitment in Pakistan/other jurisdiction as may be advised by the Central Government from time to time or in strategic sectors/specific geographies in accordance with rule 9 of OI Rules shall be forwarded by the AD banks from their constituents to the Reserve Bank as per the laid down procedure for onward submission to the Central Government.

# **5. Approval from the Reserve Bank**

Financial commitment by an Indian entity, exceeding USD 1 (one) billion (or its equivalent) in a financial year shall require prior approval of the Reserve Bank even when the total financial commitment of the Indian entity is within the eligible limit under the automatic route.

# **6. No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the lender bank/regulatory body/investigative agency**

(1) Any person resident in India having an account appearing as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA) or is classified as wilful defaulter or is under investigation by a financial sector regulator/ investigative agency shall obtain an NOC from the lender bank/regulatory body/investigative agency concerned in accordance with rule 10 of OI Rules, before making financial commitment or undertaking disinvestment.

(2) Where an Indian entity has already issued a guarantee in accordance with the FEMA provisions before an investigation has begun or account is classified as NPA/wilful defaulter and subsequently is required to honour such contractual obligation, such remittance due to the invocation will not constitute fresh financial commitment and hence NOC shall not be required.

## **7. Rights issue and bonus shares**

(1) A person resident in India, who has acquired and continues to hold equity capital in a foreign entity in accordance with the OI Rules/Regulations may acquire equity capital through exercise of rights or by way of bonus shares in accordance with rule 7 of the OI Rules.

(2) The acquisition of equity capital through exercise of such rights shall be reported in Form FC. Where such person does not exercise the rights but renounces such rights in favour of a person resident in India or a person resident outside India, such renouncement shall not require reporting. Further, the acquisition of bonus shares shall not be treated as fresh financial commitment and will not require reporting.

### **8. Acquisition of a foreign entity through bidding or tender procedure**

(1) AD banks may, on being approached by an eligible person resident in India, allow remittance towards Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) after obtaining Form A2 duly filled in or may issue bid bond guarantee on their behalf in accordance with regulation 9(5) of OI Regulations for participation in bidding or tender procedure for acquisition of a foreign entity. On winning the bid, AD banks may facilitate further remittances to the foreign entity so acquired after obtaining Form FC duly filled in and report such financial commitment.

(2) AD banks, while permitting remittance towards EMD should advise the Indian entity/investor that in case they are not successful in the bid, they shall repatriate the amount remitted in accordance with [Notification No. FEMA 9\(R\)/2015-RB.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10258&Mode=0)

(3) In cases where such a person resident in India, after being successful in the bid/tender decides not to proceed further with the investment, AD banks shall ensure the bona fides of transaction while permitting the invocation of bid-bond guarantee or forfeiture of EMD.

The valuation in accordance with pricing guidelines, wherever applicable, shall be done upfront.

### **11. Mode of Payment**

- (iii) A person resident in India shall not make any payment on behalf of any foreign entity other than by way of financial commitment as permitted under the OI Rules/Regulations.
- (iv) Any investment/financial commitment in Nepal and Bhutan shall be done in a manner as provided in Notification No. FEMA 14(R)/2016-RB, namely, [Foreign Exchange Management](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10392&Mode=0)  [\(Manner of Receipt and Payment\) Regulations,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10392&Mode=0) 2016.

#### **12. Pricing Guidelines**

(1) The AD bank, before facilitating an overseas investment related transaction, shall ensure compliance with the provisions contained in rule 16 of OI Rules. With respect to the documents to be taken by the AD bank, they shall be guided by their board approved policy, which may, inter alia, provide for taking into consideration the valuation as per any internationally accepted pricing methodology for valuation. The AD bank shall put in place a board approved policy within two months from the date of these directions.

(2) Such policy may also provide for scenarios where the valuation may not be insisted upon, such as (i) transfer on account of merger, amalgamation or demerger or liquidation, where the price has been approved by the competent Court/Tribunal as per the laws in India and/or the host

jurisdiction or (ii) price is readily available on a recognised stock exchange, *etc.* The policy shall also clearly provide for additional documents such as the audited financial statements of the foreign entity, *etc.* that may be taken by the AD banks for ascertaining the bona fides in cases involving write-off of the investment.

## **13. Transfer or liquidation**

A person resident in India holding equity capital in accordance with OI Rules may transfer such investment in accordance with rule 17 of OI Rules. It is clarified that where the transferor is required to repatriate all the dues before disinvestment, such requirement shall not apply to the dues that do not arise on account of investment in equity or debt like export receivables, *etc.*

## **14. Restructuring**

(1) A person resident in India who has made ODI in a foreign entity, may permit restructuring of the balance sheet by such foreign entity in accordance with rule 18 of OI Rules. The aggregate investment in both the equity and debt of the foreign entity shall be taken into consideration for computing the proportionate amount of accumulated losses. However, in case the restructuring involves only equity, investment only in equity of the foreign entity may be taken into consideration for computing proportionate losses.

(2) The certificate required to be furnished in accordance with rule 18 of OI Rules shall mention the amount of accumulated losses as per the audited balance sheet of the foreign entity, the proportionate amount of accumulated losses based upon the share of the Indian entity/investor, the amount of diminution in the value of the outstanding dues towards the Indian entity/investor post restructuring and that such diminution does not exceed the proportionate amount of accumulated losses.

(3) These provisions shall not be used where the assets are simply revalued in the books of the Indian entity without any restructuring of the balance sheet of the foreign entity.

## **15. Opening of Foreign Currency Account abroad by an Indian entity**

An Indian entity may open, hold and maintain Foreign Currency Account (FCA) abroad for the purpose of making ODI in accordance with the provisions contained in Regulation 5 (D) of Notification No. FEMA.10(R)/2015-RB, namely, [Foreign Exchange Management \(Foreign](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10444&Mode=0)  [Currency Accounts by a resident in India\) Regulations, 2015.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10444&Mode=0)

(2) A person resident in India acquiring equity capital in a foreign entity, which is reckoned as ODI, shall submit the evidence of investment as per regulation 9(1) of OI Regulations to the AD bank within six months, failing which the funds remitted overseas shall be repatriated within the said period of six months. The evidence of investment shall be retained by the designated AD bank, who shall monitor the receipt of required documents and satisfy themselves about the bona fides of the documents so received.

(3) Form FC shall be submitted along with requisite documents to AD bank for obtaining UIN on or before making initial ODI. The AD bank after due verification shall report the details in the OID application for allotment of UIN. Any remittance towards a foreign entity shall be facilitated by the AD bank only after obtaining the necessary UIN for such entity. The allotment of UIN does not constitute an approval from the Reserve Bank for the investment made/to be made in the foreign entity. The issue of UIN only signifies taking on record of the investment for maintaining the database. Further, with effect from June 01, 2012, an auto generated e-mail giving the details of UIN allotted to the foreign entity is forwarded to the AD bank/Indian investor as confirmation of allotment of UIN, and no separate letter is issued by the Reserve Bank.

#### **17. Reporting**

(1) All reporting with respect to overseas investment by a person resident in India shall be made in accordance with regulation 10 of OI Regulations through the designated AD bank as per the revised reporting forms and instructions contained in the ["Master Direction –](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10202) Reporting under [Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999"](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10202).

(3) The Annual Performance Report (APR) shall be certified by a chartered accountant where the statutory audit is not applicable, including in case of resident individuals. It is also clarified that where APR is required to be filed jointly, either one investor may be authorised by other investors for filing APR, or such persons may jointly file the APR.

(4) A resident individual making overseas investment must comply with the reporting requirements as provided under the OI Regulations and reporting shall also be done as provided under the LRS where such investment is reckoned towards the LRS limit. Acquisition of foreign securities by way of inheritance or gift in accordance with paragraph 2 of Schedule III of OI Rules shall not be reckoned towards the LRS limit and hence, shall not require reporting under LRS.

## **18. Delay in Reporting**

(1) In case a person resident in India has made a delay in filing/submitting the requisite form/return/document, such person may file/submit the requisite form/return/ document, *etc.* and pay the Late Submission Fee (LSF) through the designated AD bank in accordance with regulation 11 of OI Regulations.

An Indian entity, within the overall limit provided in schedule I of the OI Rules and subject to regulation 3 of OI Regulations, may make financial commitment by way of ODI as per schedule I of the OI Rules, financial commitment by way of debt as per regulation 4 of OI Regulations and non-fund based financial commitment as per regulations 5, 6 and 7 of OI Regulations. The following is further provided:

(1) In case of swap of securities both the legs of transaction shall comply with FEMA provisions, as applicable.

- e) A group company of the Indian entity may extend a guarantee in accordance with the OI Regulations if such group company is eligible to make ODI as per the OI Rules and such guarantee shall be counted towards the utilisation of the financial commitment limit of such

group company and shall be reported by the group company concerned. In case of a resident individual promoter, the same shall be counted towards the financial commitment limit of the Indian entity and accordingly be reported by the Indian entity. The concept of utilising the net worth of the subsidiary/holding company by the Indian entity has been discontinued henceforth. Further, for computing the financial commitment limit of the group company, any fund-based exposure of such group company to the Indian entity or of the Indian entity to such group company, as the case may be, shall be deducted from the net worth of such group company.

In case a foreign entity is being set up by two or more persons resident in India, then all such persons shall route all transactions in respect of that foreign entity only through one designated AD bank. However, different AD banks may be designated, if required, for different foreign entities.

(2) In case such a person resident in India wants to switch over to another AD, it may approach the new AD after obtaining an NOC from the existing AD bank.

(3) All communication from the person resident in India to the Reserve Bank should be routed through the nodal branch of the designated AD bank. For proper follow up, the AD bank shall maintain person-wise record in respect of each foreign entity.

## **27. Overseas investment under OI Rules/Regulations**

(1) AD banks may allow remittance towards overseas investment up to the permissible limits on receipt of application in Form FC together with form A-2, duly filled in, from the person making such investments subject to their complying with the conditions prescribed in the OI Rules/Regulations/Directions. AD banks shall render themselves liable for penal action under section 11 and 13 of FEMA, 1999, if they facilitate remittances towards financial commitment without obtaining the requisite duly completed Form FC.

*Explanation*: AD banks may note that an additional timeline of 15 days is made available to them for reporting of investments/financial commitment by their constituents to RBI in the OID application (other than first remittance, which requires to be reported in OID system before executing the transaction, to generate UIN) and is not to be availed by the Indian entities/resident individuals for submission of forms and documents to the AD bank.

(2) AD banks should allow remittance towards loan to the foreign entity and/or issue bank guarantee to/on behalf of the foreign entity only after ensuring that the Indian entity has made ODI and has control in the foreign entity.

(3) The Reserve Bank will not, generally, specify the documents which should be verified by the AD banks for ensuring the bona fides of the transactions. In this connection, attention of authorised persons is drawn to sub-section (5) of Section 10 of the FEMA, 1999 which provides that an authorised person shall require any person desiring to transact in foreign exchange to make such a declaration and to give such information as will reasonably satisfy him that the transaction will not involve and is not designed for the purpose of any contravention or evasion of the provisions of the FEMA, 1999 or any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order issued thereunder. AD banks shall put in place a standard policy laying down the requirements or documents or information to be obtained by their branches to ensure compliance with said provisions of FEMA.

(4) AD banks shall ensure bona fides of the transaction, compliance with FEMA provisions, compliance with [Know Your Customer \(KYC\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) Guidelines and compliance with anti-money laundering guidelines/laws. Any doubtful case/suspicious transaction shall be referred to Directorate of Enforcement (DoE) for further investigation and necessary action.

(5) In case of ODI by way of capitalisation of export proceeds or other entitlements, Indian entity/resident individual shall make an application in Form FC to its designated AD bank. AD bank may ensure necessary reporting in Form FC, compliance with OI Rules/Regulations and necessary reporting in EDPMS, wherever applicable, for facilitating such transactions. In case where such proceeds are overdue beyond the period specified for realisation/repatriation, before permitting such capitalisation AD bank may grant necessary extension post proper due diligence. (6) Pre-incorporation expenses – AD bank may allow remittance towards pre-incorporation expenses after satisfying itself of the reasonableness, up to a maximum of USD 100,000 per foreign entity. Such remittances made by a resident individual shall be reckoned towards their LRS limit. A person resident in India may capitalise pre-incorporation expenses (*i.e.*, financial commitment by way of ODI) or recognise such expenses as receivables (*i.e.*, financial commitment by way of debt) or account them as expenses in their books. It is clarified that unless recognised as financial commitment such expenses shall not attract provisions of OI Rules/Regulations.

# **28. General procedural instructions for online reporting**

(1) The existing application for online reporting of overseas investment related transactions by Authorised dealers (ADs) has provision for Maker, Checker and Authoriser. The AD Maker shall initiate the transaction and submit to the AD Checker for verification before submission to Reserve Bank. In case of delay in reporting for any reason the transaction shall be reported to RBI only after a middle management level officer designated as an authoriser ratifies it by recording the reasons for the same.

(2) The AD Maker, AD Checker and AD Authoriser as above identified by the AD Bank may obtain a user-id, if not obtained already, for accessing the online OID application by submitting a request in the prescribed format as per appendix A.

(3) The online reporting shall be made by the Centralised Unit/Nodal Office of AD banks. The overseas investment application is hosted on the Reserve Bank's Website at [https://fed.rbi.org.in.](https://fed.rbi.org.in/) AD banks shall be responsible for the validity of the information reported online.

(4) Reserve Bank reserves the right to place the information received through the forms in the public domain.
