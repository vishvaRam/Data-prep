# **Guidance Notes for Asset Reconstruction Companies**

The Bank has evolved Guidance Note, gist of which is given below. The words and expressions used in these notes shall have the same meaning as in the Act.

## **(1) Acquisition of Financial Assets**

i) Every ARC is required to evolve Asset Acquisition Policy within 90 days of getting the certificate of registration which shall, inter alia, provide that the transactions will take place in a transparent manner and at a fair price in a well-informed market, and the transactions are executed on arm's length basis by exercise of due diligence.

ii) The share of financial assets to be acquired from the bank / FI should be appropriately and objectively worked out keeping in view the provision in the Act requiring consent of secured creditors holding not less than 60% of the amount outstanding to a borrower for the purpose of enforcement of security interest;

iii) For easy and faster realisability, all the financial assets due from a single debtor to various banks/ FIs may be considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets having linkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure relatively faster and easy realisation.

iv) Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of assets for acquisition. Assets classified as [56](#page-2-0)Special Mentioned Account (SMA) in the books of the originator may also be acquired.

v) Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding commitments, if any, of any bank/ FI to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security interest in non-fund transactions, should provide for the relative commitments to continue with bank/ FI, till demand for funding arises.

vi) Loans not backed by proper documentation should be avoided.

vii) As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and should ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in scientific and objective manner. Valuation may be done internally or by engaging an independent agency, depending upon the value of the assets. Ideally, valuation may be entrusted to the committee authorised to approve acquisition of assets, which may

carry out the task in line with an Asset Acquisition Policy laid down by the board of directors in this regard.

viii) The assets acquired by ARC should be transferred to the trusts set up by the ARC at the price at which these were acquired from the originator of the asset. However, there is no restriction on acquisition of assets from banks/ FIs directly in the books of trusts set up by ARC.

### (2) **Issuance of SRs**

i) Every ARC shall issue the SRs through the trust set up exclusively for the purpose. The trusteeship of such trust shall vest with the ARC.

ii) The trust shall issue SRs only to QBs and such SRs shall be transferable/ assignable only in favour of other QBs.

iii) Every ARC intending to issue SRs shall make disclosures in the offer document as prescribed by the Bank from time to time.

[57](#page-3-0)[(iv) Commonality and conflict of interest, if any, between the ARC and Rating Agency should be disclosed.

### **(v) Special features of SRs**

(a) SRs cannot be strictly characterized as debt instruments since they combine the features of both equity and debt. However, these are recognized as securities under Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956.

(b) The cash flows from the underlying assets cannot be predicted in terms of value and intervals.

(c) These instruments when rated would generally be below investment grade. These instruments are privately placed.

#### **(vi) Rating/ Grading of SRs**

[58](#page-4-0)(a) Every ARC shall mandatorily obtain initial rating/ grading of SRs from a [59](#page-4-1)[SEBI registered] CRA within a period of six months from the date of acquisition of assets and declare forthwith, the NAV of the SRs issued by it. Thereafter, ARCs will get the rating/ grading of SRs reviewed from a registered CRA as on June 30, and December 31 every year and declare the NAV of SRs forthwith, to enable the QBs to value their investment in SRs. [60A](#page-4-2)RCs shall retain a CRA for at least 6 rating cycles (of half year each). If a CRA is changed mid-way through these 6 rating cycles, the ARC shall disclose the reason for such change. For arriving at NAV, ARC shall get the SRs rated on 'recovery rating scale' and require the rating agencies to disclose the assumptions and rationale for rating. [61](#page-4-3)ARCs shall mandatorily obtain the recovery rating from the CRAs and disclose the assumptions and rationale behind the rating to SR holders.

(b) The rating/ grading should be based on 'recovery risk' as against 'default' which is the basis for rating assignments in normal assets, i.e. how much more can be recovered instead of timely payment. Rating should reflect present value of the anticipated recoverability of future cash flows.

(c) The ratings will be assigned on a specifically developed rating scale called "Recovery Rating (RR) scale". Each rating category in the recovery scale will have an associate range of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which can be used for arriving at NAV of SRs. Symbols should be assigned by rating agencies to the associated range of recovery, which would inter-se not deviate by a specified percentage points, say (+/ -) 10%. The rating would be indicative.

(d) The Recovery Rating should be assessed after factoring in any other relevant obligation and not on the original debt obligation.

(e) The other key factors that should be factored in while assigning Recovery Rating are extent of debt acquired, composition of lenders, collaterals available, security and seniority of debt, individual lender vis-Ã -vis institutional lender,

estimated cash flows, uncertainty in realising expected cash flows in initial period, management, business risk, financial risk, etc.

(f) The Recovery Rating should reflect changes like change in resolution strategy of the ARC that take place from time to time.

(g) The Recovery Rating will factor in likely cash flows from the underlying impaired assets till the maturity of the SRs.

(h) The Recovery Rating should comprise of rating of not only the SRs of the scheme as a whole but wherever feasible a desegregation of each component in the scheme, which means the underlying assets of each entity in the scheme forming the basket should also be rated.

(i) The Rating Agency should disclose the rationale for rating on request.

#### **(vii) Methodology for valuation of SRs for declaration of NAV**

Each rating category in the recovery scale will have an associate **range** of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which can be used for computing NAV of SRs. The NAV should be restricted within the recovery range associated with the rating assigned to the SRs. The ARC based on its recovery experience should choose a particular percentage within the recovery range indicated by the Rating Agency. The Recovery Rating percentage so picked by the ARC multiplied by the face value of the SR will give the NAV. The ARC should provide the rationale for selection of the particular percentage of Recovery Rating. For example, if range is between 81% - 90%, ARC may pick up 87% based on its judgement. The face value of say Rs 10 multiplied by the recovery percentage i.e. 87% would give the NAV as Rs 8.70].
