## **Dealing in Rupee Interest Rate Derivative products - Small Finance Banks**

Please refer to paragraph 4 of [Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=57639) issued as a part of the [Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement for 2024-25](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=57637) dated April [05, 2024](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=57637) read with Paragraph 1.10 of the ['Operating Guidelines for Small Finance](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10636&Mode=0)  Banks' dated [October 6, 2016.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10636&Mode=0)

2. Extant guidelines permit Small Finance Banks (SFBs) to use only Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) for the purpose of proprietary hedging. In order to expand the avenues available to the SFBs for hedging interest rate risk in their balance sheet and commercial operations more effectively as well as with a view to provide them with greater flexibility, it has now been decided to allow them to deal in permissible rupee interest rate derivative products for hedging interest rate risk in terms of the [Rupee](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=47412)  [Interest Rate Derivatives \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2019](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=47412) dated June 26, 2019, as amended from time to time.

## **Applicability**

- 3. This circular is applicable to all Small Finance Banks.
- 4. These instructions shall come into force with immediate effect.

Yours faithfully,

(Usha Janakiraman) Chief General Manager
