### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM)**

### **1. Background**

The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Government of India launched the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) by restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) with effect from 01st April 2013 [\(RBI Circular No. RBI/2012-13/559 dated 27](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8075&Mode=0)  [June 2013\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8075&Mode=0). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. The DAY-NRLM is the flagship program of Government of India for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions of the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State specific poverty reduction action plans. The key features of DAY-NRLM have been furnished in [Annex I.](#page-11-0)

### **2. Women SHGs and their Federations**

2.1््DAY-NRLM promotes affinity-based women Self Help Groups (SHGs). However, only in case of groups to be formed with persons with disabilities and other special categories like elders and transgenders, DAY-NRLM may have both men and women in the Self-Help Groups.

2.2 Women SHGs under DAY-NRLM consist of 10-20 members. In case of special SHGs i.e., groups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, and groups formed in remote tribal areas, this number may be a minimum of 5 members.

2.3 Federations of Self Help Groups formed at village, gram panchayat, cluster or higher level may be registered under appropriate Acts prevailing in their respective states.

### **Financial Assistance to the SHGs**

### **3. Revolving Fund**

DAY-NRLM, MoRD, will provide Revolving Fund (RF) support as corpus ranging between ₹20,000 - ₹30,000 per SHG to strengthen their institutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit history within the group. SHGs in existence for a minimum period of 3/6 months and follow the norms of good SHGs known as 'Panchasutras', *viz*., regular meetings, regular savings, regular internal lending, regular recoveries and maintenance of proper books of accounts, and which have not received any RF earlier will be eligible for such support.

### **4. Capital Subsidy**

No capital subsidy would be sanctioned to any SHG under DAY-NRLM.

## **5. Community Investment Support Fund (CIF)**

CIF will be provided by MoRD to the SHGs promoted under DAY-NRLM in all blocks and will be routed through the village level/cluster level federations, to be maintained in perpetuity by the federations. The CIF may be used by the federations to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to undertake common/collective socio-economic activities.

### **6. Interest Subvention**

DAY-NRLM has a provision for interest subvention for women SHGs. Salient features of the Scheme are enclosed in [Annex II.](#page-15-0)

The individual should be running a viable economic enterprise. Banks are advised to share data on individual loans to women SHGs members in a mutually agreed format and periodicity with DAY-NRLM.
- (ii) One woman in every SHG under DAY-NRLM may be provided a loan up to ₹1 lakh under the MUDRA Scheme, if she is otherwise eligible.
- (iii) Banks are advised to provide minimum OD facility of ₹5000 to every woman SHG member having PMJDY account in accordance with the guidelines issued by Indian Banks' Association (IBA). Banks may regularly share data on OD limit to women SHGs' members in a mutually agreed format and periodicity with DAY-NRLM.
- (iv) DAY-NRLM has created 'Women Enterprise Acceleration Fund' for individual women SHGs members eligible as per clause (i) and (ii) above. Salient features of the Fund are enclosed in [Annex-III.](#page-17-0)
- (v) Credit to Producer Groups/Producer Organisations: To facilitate women SHG members getting a better price for their produce through collectivization/aggregation/ value addition, banks may consider extending loans to select well performing Producers Groups/Producers Organisations under DAY-NRLM for their commercial activities as per their lending policy.

#### **7.3.5 Purpose of loan and repayment**:

- (i) The loan amount would be distributed among members based on the MCP prepared by the SHGs. The loans may be used by members for meeting social needs, high cost debt swapping, construction or repair of house, construction of toilets and taking up sustainable livelihoods or to finance any viable common activity started by the SHGs.
- (ii) In order to facilitate use of loans for augmenting livelihoods of SHG members, at least 50% of loans above ₹1 lakh, 75% of loans above ₹4 lakh and at least 85% of loans above ₹6 lakh should be used primarily for income generating productive purposes. MCPs prepared by SHGs would form the basis for determining the purpose and usage of loans.

(iii) For loan to SHGs above ₹10 lakh and up to ₹20 lakh, a margin not exceeding 10% of the loan amount exceeding ₹10 lakh may be obtained as per the bank's approved loan policy.

#### **7.3.7 Dealing with Defaulters<sup>2</sup>** :

Willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY-NRLM. In case willful defaulters are members of a group, they may be allowed to benefit from the thrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of Revolving Fund. However, as regards credit facilities, the group may be financed excluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. Banks should not deny loans to SHGs on the grounds of family members of individual members of SHG being defaulters with the bank. Further, nonwillful defaulters should not be debarred from receiving loans. In case default is due to genuine reasons, banks may follow the norms prescribed for restructuring the credit facilities.

### **7.3.8 Documentation and follow- up**

- (i) Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to the SHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms and conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated with every transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of loan, banks may clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.
- (ii) Bank branches may designate one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go to the field and attend the meetings of theSHGs and Federations to observe the operations of the SHGs, keep a track of the regularity of the SHGs' meetings and monitor their performance.

### **8 Recovery:**

Prompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall take all possible measures, such as personal contact and organization of joint recovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DMMUs)/District Rural Development Agency (DRDAs) to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY-

<sup>2</sup> As defined in the [RBI Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters dated July 01, 2015,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9907) updated from time to time.

NRLM every month and furnish the list in the Block Level Bankers Committee (BLBC) and District Consultative Committee (DCC) meetings. This would enable the DAY-NRLM staff at the block/district level to assist the bankers in initiating recovery.

#### **9 Credit Target Planning and Monitoring of the Scheme**

- (i) Banks may set up cells for Self Help Groups in their respective Regional/Zonal Offices. These cells should periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the Scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data to the Head Office and the DAY-NRLM units at the districts/blocks. The consolidated data may also be discussed in the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC), BLBC and DCC meetings regularly to maintain effective communication with the state staff and all banks.
- (ii) State Level Bankers' Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub-committee on SHG Bank Linkage. The sub-committee should consist of members from all banks operating in the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural Development Department, Secretary-Institutional Finance and representatives of Development Departments etc. Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, the SLBC sub-committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the districtwise, block-wise and branch-wise credit plan. The sub-committee should consider the existing SHGs, new SHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation. The sub-committee shall discuss a specific agenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG-Bank linkage and the issues/constraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of the SLBC should be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub-committee.
- (iii) The district-wise credit plans should be communicated to the District Consultative Committee (DCC). The block- wise/cluster-wise targets are to be communicated to the bank branches through the Controllers**.**
- (iv) District Consultative Committee: The DCC shall regularly monitor the flow of credit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that constrain such flow of credit. This committee should include DMMU staff representing DAY-NRLM and office bearers of SHG federations in addition to other members.
- (v) Block Level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall take up issues of SHG Bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/Federations of the SHGs should be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch-wise status of SHG credit shall be monitored at the BLBC.
- (vi) Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the progress report and the delinquency report under various activities of DAY-NRLM in the format at [Annex–IV](#page-22-0) and [V](#page-23-0) to the LDM every month for onward submission to Special Sub-Committee constituted by SLBC.
- (vii) Reporting to RBI: Banks may furnish a state-wise consolidated report on the progress made under DAY-NRLM to RBI on quarterly basis within a month from the end of the concerned quarter.
- (viii) Lead Bank Return (LBR): Existing procedure of submitting LBR is to be continued.

### **10 Financial Literacy:**

Financial Literacy is one of the important strategies to spread awareness on financial behavior and keep households informed about various financial products and services. DAY-NRLM has trained and deployed a large number of cadre called 'Financial Literacy Community Resource Persons (FL-CRPs)' to carry out financial literacy camps at village level. Financial Literacy Centers (FLC) established by various banks may coordinate with respective SRLMs and utilize the services of FL-CRPs to conduct village camps on Financial Literacy.

#### **11 Data Sharing**:

Banks may share the following data in mutually agreed formats/intervals with DAY-NRLM or State Rural Livelihood Missions (SRLMs). While sharing such data, banks may ensure conformity with the provisions of paragraph 25 of the Master Circular on Customer Service in Banks dated July 01, 2015. As regards consent of customers, as mentioned in para 25 (iv) of the above Master Circular, banks may ensure that consent may be obtained specially and separately from the customers and not as a consent in the form of a general clause either in the applications for opening the account or for the loan.

- (i) Data for initiating various strategies including recovery etc. Such data may be drawn directly from the CBS platform.
- (ii) Data of Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri

Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) to facilitate higher enrollment and claim settlement under the mentioned schemes.

(iii) Data of all SHG transactions being done at Business Correspondent points using dual authentication technology.

### **12 DAY-NRLM support to Banks:**

- (i) SRLM would develop strategic partnerships with major banks at various levels. It would invest in creating enabling conditions for both the banks and the poor for a mutually rewarding relationship.
- (ii) SRLM would assist the SHGs through imparting financial literacy, extending counselling services on savings, credit, insurance, pension and training on microinvestment planning embedded in capacity building.
- (iii) SRLMs would extend support to banks for improving quality of banking services to poor clients including follow-up for recovery of over dues if any, by positioning customer relationship managers (Bank Mitra/Sakhi) with every bank branch involved in financing of SHGs.
- (iv)Leveraging IT mobile technologies and institutions of the poor, youth or SHG members as business facilitators and business correspondents.
- (v) Community Based Repayment Mechanism (CBRM): One exclusive sub-committee for SHG Bank Linkage may be formed at village/cluster/block level which would provide support to the banks in ensuring proper utilization of loan amount, recovery etc. The bank linkage sub-committee members from each village level federation along with project staff would meet once in a month under the chairmanship of the Branch Manager in the branch premises with the agenda items relating to bank linkage.

#### **Key Features of DAY-NRLM**

<span id="page-11-0"></span>

**1. Universal Social Mobilization:** To begin with, DAY-NRLM would ensure that at least one member from each identified rural poor household, preferably a woman, is brought under the SHG network in a time bound manner. Subsequently, both women and men would be organized for addressing livelihood issues i.e., farmers organizations, milk producers' cooperatives, weavers' associations, etc. All these institutions are inclusive and no poor would be left out of them. DAY-NRLM would ensure adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all households under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criterion as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC).

**2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP):** DAY-NRLM would undertake a community based process for covering the target beneficiaries i.e., participation of the poor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound methodology and tools *(social mapping and well-being categorization, deprivation indicators)* and also locally understood and accepted criteria ensures local consensus that inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity.

The households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) along with households identified through the P.I.P process would be accepted as DAY-NRLM target group and would be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after P.I.P process would be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.

Till the P.I.P process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/block, the rural households with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list would be targeted under DAY-NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY-NRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC list but are as poor as those included in SECC list.

**3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor:** Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their village level and higher-level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY-NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY-NRLM would promote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers' cooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, backward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets etc. The Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.

**4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor.** There are existing institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY-NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The self-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY-NRLM.

**5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity Building and Skill Building:** DAY-NRLM would ensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi-pronged approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY-NRLM would make extensive use of Information, Communication & Technology (ICT) to make knowledge dissemination and capacity building more effective.

**6. Revolving Fund and Community Investment Support Fund (C.I.F):** A Revolving Fund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long-run and immediate consumption needs in the short-run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used for meeting the members' credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat bank finance. The C.I.F would be routed to the SHGs through the Federations. The key to coming out of poverty is continuous and easy access to finance, at reasonable rates, till they accumulate their own funds in large measure.

**7. Universal Financial Inclusion:** DAY-NRLM would work towards achieving universal financial inclusion, beyond basic banking services to all the poor households, SHGs and their federations. DAY-NRLM would work on both demand and supply side of Financial Inclusion. On the demand side, it would promote financial literacy among the poor and provide catalytic capital to the SHGs and their federations. On the supply side, it would coordinate with the financial sector and encourage use of ICT based financial technologies, business correspondents and community facilitators like 'Bank Mitras'. It would also work towards universal coverage of rural poor against loss of life, health and assets. Further, it would work on remittances, especially in areas where migration is endemic.

**8. Provision of Interest Subvention:** The rural poor need credit at low rate of interest and in multiple doses to make their ventures economically viable. In order to ensure affordable credit, DAY-NRLM has a provision for subvention on interest rates.

**9. Funding Pattern:** DAY-NRLM is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme and the financing of the programme would be shared between the Centre and the States in the ratio of 60:40 (90:10 in case of North Eastern States including Sikkim; completely from the Centre in case of UTs). The Central allocation earmarked for the states would broadly be distributed in relation to the incidence of poverty in the states.

**10. Implementation in Blocks:** The blocks that are taken up for implementation of DAY-NRLM would have a full complement of trained professional staff and cover a whole range of activities of universal and intense social and financial inclusion, livelihoods, partnerships etc.

**11**. **Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs).** RSETI concept is built on the model pioneered by Rural Development Self Employment Institute (RUDSETI) – a collaborative partnership between SDME Trust and Canara Bank. The model envisages transforming unemployed youth into confident self-employed entrepreneurs through a short duration experiential learning programme followed by systematic long duration hand holding support. The need-based training builds entrepreneurship qualities, improves self-confidence, reduces risk of failure and develops the trainees into change agents. Banks are fully involved in selection, training and post training follow up stages. The needs of the poor articulated through the institutions of the poor would guide RSETIs in preparing the participants/trainees in their pursuits of self-employment and enterprises. DAY-NRLM would encourage public sector banks to set up RSETIs in all districts of the country.

### **Interest Subvention Scheme for Women SHGs**
