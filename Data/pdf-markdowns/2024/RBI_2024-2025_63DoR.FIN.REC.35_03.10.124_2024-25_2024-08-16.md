All Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platforms

Dear Sir/ Madam,

## **Review of Master Direction - Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platform (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2017**

Please refer to the Master Direction - [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11137) Peer to Peer [Lending Platform \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2017](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11137) (the Directions).

2. The Directions envisaged the Non-Banking Financial Company – Peer to Peer Lending Platform (NBFC-P2P Lending Platform) to act as an intermediary providing online marketplace / platform to the participants involved in peer to peer lending. Accordingly, the Directions had laid down clear guidelines regarding various aspects of functioning of NBFC-P2P Lending Platforms. However, it has been observed that some of these platforms have adopted certain practices which are violative of the said Directions. Such practices include, among others, violation of the prescribed funds transfer mechanism, promoting peer to peer lending as an investment product with features like tenure linked assured minimum returns, providing liquidity options and at times acting like deposit takers and lenders instead of being a platform. Such violations, when observed, have been dealt with bilaterally by the Reserve Bank of India for remediation.

3. In view of the above, it has been decided to elaborate and clarify certain provisions with some modifications for proper implementation of the Directions. The amended provisions of the Directions are enclosed in the [Annex](#page-2-0) to this circular.

4. The amended provisions contained in this circular except item I(f)(ii) of the enclosed Annex shall come into effect immediately. Item I(f)(ii) of the Annex shall be effective from ninety days of the date of this circular.

5. The Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11137) Peer to Peer Lending [Platform \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2017](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11137) stands modified accordingly.

Yours faithfully,

(J.P. Sharma) Chief General Manager
