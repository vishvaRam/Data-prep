The Chairman / Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officer [All Commercial Banks including Regional Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks, Local Area Banks and Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks other than Salary Earners' Banks]

Madam/ Dear Sir,

### **Priority Sector Lending – Amendments to the Master Directions**

Please refer to [Master Directions \(MD\) on Priority Sector Lending \(PSL\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) dated [September 04, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) as updated from time to time. The following paras of the Directions stand amended in view of factors detailed thereunder.

### 2. **Para 7 - Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement:**

The MD specifies that the lists of districts with comparatively high and low PSL credit detailed in Annex IA and IB of the MD are valid until FY 2023-24 subject to review thereafter. Based on a review, the lists of districts have been updated. These lists will remain valid until FY 2026-27 and will be reviewed thereafter. Accordingly, from FY 2024-25 onwards, a higher weight (125%) would be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) would be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). Therefore, [para 7 of the](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#Adjustments)  [MD on PSL](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#Adjustments) has been updated as mentioned above.

## 3. **Para 9 - Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises:**

The definition of MSMEs has been referenced to the [Master Direction](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11060) - Lending to [Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises \(MSME\) Sector,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11060) for clarity.

## 4. **Para 27 - Monitoring of Priority Sector Lending targets:**

The MD specifies that UCBs shall furnish data on priority sector advances in the reporting formats 'Statement I' and 'Statement II (Part A to D)' at quarterly and annual intervals, to the Regional Offices of DoS, RBI. This provision has been repealed in terms of Master Direction - [Reserve Bank of India \(Filing of Supervisory Returns\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12613)  Directions – [2024 \(MD on FSR\) dated February 27, 2024.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12613) The applicable return for reporting PSL data by UCBs has been prescribed at Sl. No. 61 of Annex III of the MD on FSR. Accordingly, para 27 of MD as applicable to UCBs has been updated.

5. The relevant amendments made in the MD on PSL are detailed in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)

6. The [Master Directions](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) and [FAQs](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/FAQDisplay.aspx?Id=87) on Priority Sector Lending on the Bank's website have been updated accordingly.

Yours faithfully,
