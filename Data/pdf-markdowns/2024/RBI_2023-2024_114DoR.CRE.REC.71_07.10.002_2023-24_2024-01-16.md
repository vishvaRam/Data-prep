## **Master Circular on Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions – UCBs**

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>**1. General**

1.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) have been advised to fix limits on their exposure -

- (i) to individual borrowers and group borrowers;
- (ii) to specific sectors; and,
- (iii) towards unsecured advances.

1.2 In addition, these banks are also required to observe certain statutory and regulatory restrictions in respect of:

- (i) advances against shares, debentures and bonds;
- (ii) investments in shares, debentures and bonds.

1.3 Currently operative instructions on all these aspects are detailed in the following paragraphs.

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**2. Definitions**

## 2.1 Tier-I Capital

Tier-I capital as on March 31 of the preceding financial year shall be reckoned for the purpose of fixing the exposure limits. Tier-I capital for the purpose will be the same as that prescribed for computation of capital adequacy of UCBs (vide [Master Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490)  [dated April 20, 2023 on Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490), as amended from time to time.

2.2 Exposure shall include both credit exposure (Loans and Advances) and investment exposure (Non- SLR securities) as indicated below.

## 2.3 Credit Exposure

#### 2.3.1 Credit exposure shall include -

(a) funded and non-funded credit limits and underwriting and similar commitments;

(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing and hire purchase financing; and,

(c) ad hoc limits sanctioned to the borrowers to meet the contingencies.

2.3.2 Credit exposure shall not include loans and advances granted against the security of bank's own term deposits.

2.3.3 The sanctioned limit or outstanding whichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at credit exposure limit. Further, in case of fully drawn term loans, where there is no scope of re-drawal of any portion of the sanctioned limit, banks may reckon the outstanding for arriving at credit exposure limit.

2.3.4 In respect of non-funded credit limit, 100 per cent of such limit or outstanding, whichever is higher, need be taken into account for the purpose.

2.3.5 The level of individual bank's share in Consortium / Multiple Banking / Syndication shall be governed by single borrower / group exposure.

## 2.4 Investment Exposure (Non-SLR securities)

UCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Chapter VII of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [on 'Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) dated April [1, 2023,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) as updated from time to time.

#### 2.5 Group

2.5.1 The decision in regard to definition of a group is left to the perception of the UCBs, which are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele. The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs may, therefore, be decided by the UCBs on the basis of relevant information available with them, the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management and effective control.

2.5.2 The different firms with one or more common partners engaged in the same line of business, *viz*., manufacturing, processing, trading activity, etc. shall be deemed to be connected group and units coming under common ownership shall be deemed to be a single party.

#### 2.6 Unsecured advances

Unsecured advances shall include clean overdrafts, loans against personal security, clean bills or *Multani hundies* purchased or discounted, cheques purchased and drawals allowed against cheques sent for collection but shall exclude:

(i) advances backed by guarantee of the central or state governments, public sector financial institutions, banks and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation;

(iii) advances against trust receipts;

(iv) advances against inland Document against Acceptance (D/A) bills drawn under letters of credit;

(v) advances against inland D/A bills (even where such bills are not drawn under letters of credit) having a usance of not exceeding 90 days;

(vi) advances granted to salaried employees against personal security, provided that the Co-operative Societies Act of the State concerned contains an obligatory provision for deduction of periodical loan instalments by the employer out of the employee's salary / wages to meet the bank's claims and provided further that the bank has taken advantages of this provision in respect of each of such advances;

(vii) advances against supply bills drawn on private parties of repute and receipted challans of public limited companies and concerns of repute and not outstanding for more than 90 days;

## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**3. Exposure Norms**

<span id="page-4-1"></span>3.1 Exposure Ceiling to Individual / Group Borrowers

3.1.1 UCBs are required to fix, with the approval of their Board of Directors, exposure ceiling in relation to their Tier-I capital. The exposure for the purpose shall comprise both credit exposure (loans and advances) and investment exposure (Non-SLR securities) as detailed at Para 2.3 and 2.4 so that -

(i) the exposure to an individual borrower does not exceed 15 per cent of Tier-I capital; and,

(ii) the exposure to a group of connected borrowers/parties does not exceed 25 per cent of Tier-I capital.

3.1.2 The exposure limits prescribed in Para 3.1.1 apply to all types of fresh exposures taken by UCBs after March 13, 2020 and UCBs were required to bring down their exposures which were in excess of the revised limits to within the aforesaid revised limits by March 31, 2023. However, where the existing exposure comprises only term loans and non-fund-based facilities, while no further exposure shall be taken on such borrowers, these facilities may be allowed to continue as per their respective repayment schedule / till maturity.

3.1.3 Whether borrowers / parties belong to a 'group of connected borrowers / parties' shall be determined based on the instructions contained at Para 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>3.2 Computation of exposure ceiling for individual / group borrowers

The exercise of computing the exposure ceilings may be conducted every year after the finalisation and audit of balance sheet of the bank and the exposure ceilings may be advised to the loan sanctioning authorities and the investment department in the bank. In view of the linking of shareholding to lending, accretion to or reduction in the share capital after the balance sheet date, may be taken into account for determining exposure ceiling at half-yearly intervals, with the approval of their Board of Directors. Accordingly, banks may, if they so desire, fix a fresh exposure limit taking into account the amount of share capital available as on 30th September. However, accretion to capital funds other than to share capital, such as half-yearly profit etc., will not be eligible for reckoning the exposure ceiling. Banks should also ensure that they do not take exposures in excess of ceiling prescribed in anticipation of infusion of capital on a future date.

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>3.3 Thresholds for value of loans

UCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than ₹25 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier-I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of ₹1 crore, per borrower / party. Tier-I capital for this purpose shall be reckoned in the manner provided in paragraph 2.1 above. Notwithstanding the above, UCBs shall adhere to the exposure limits stipulated at Para 3.1 above. UCBs which do not, at present, comply with the prescribed threshold shall be in conformity with the above requirements by March 31, 2024. It is clarified that 'loans' for the purpose shall include all types of funded and non-funded exposures in the nature of credit.

<span id="page-5-2"></span>3.4 Exposure to Housing, Real Estate and Commercial Real Estate

3.4.1 UCBs are advised to frame, with the approval of their Board of Directors, comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on the total amount of real estate loans, keeping in view the Reserve Bank of India guidelines to ensure that bank credit is used for construction activity and not for activity connected with speculation in real estate subject to the instructions in following paragraphs.

3.4.2 The exposure of UCBs to housing (including individual loans for house repairs, additions and alteration), real estate and commercial real estate loans (including Commercial Real Estate –Residential Housing) would be limited to 10 per cent of their total assets. The above ceiling of 10 per cent of total assets can be exceeded by an additional limit of 5 per cent of total assets for the purpose of grant of housing loans to individuals as per the eligibility limits for priority sector classification, as contained in [Master Direction FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated September 04, 2020,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) amended from time to time.

3.4.3 The total assets may be reckoned based on the audited balance sheet as on March 31 of the preceding financial year. For reckoning total assets, losses, intangible assets, contra items like bills receivables etc. would be excluded.

3.4.4 Working capital loans given by UCBs against hypothecation of construction materials provided to the contractors who undertake comparatively small construction on their own without receiving advance payments is exempted from the prescribed limit.

3.4.5 UCBs are not permitted to exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real estate, commercial real estate loans to the extent of funds obtained from higher financing agencies and refinance from National Housing Bank.

3.4.6 Tier-1[1](#page-6-2) UCBs are permitted to extend individual housing loans upto a maximum of ₹60 lakh per individual borrower and UCBs categorised in Tier-2 to 4 can extend individual housing loans up to a maximum of ₹140 lakh per individual borrower subject to extant prudential exposure limits.

<span id="page-12-3"></span>6.6 Bank Finance against Shares, Debentures and Bonds

6.6.1 Bank Finance to Stock Brokers

(i) UCBs are prohibited from extending any fund based or non fund based credit facilities, whether secured or unsecured, to stockbrokers against shares and debentures / bonds, or other securities, such as fixed deposits, LIC policies etc.

(ii) UCBs are not permitted to extend any facility to commodity brokers. This would include issue of guarantees on their behalf.

6.6.3 Loans against the primary / collateral security of shares / debentures should be limited to ₹ 5 lakh if the security is in physical form and up to ₹ 10 lakh if the security is in demat form.

## <span id="page-14-0"></span>6.8 Bank Finance to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)

#### 6.8.1 Admission of NBFCs as Members

(i) For availing loans or advances from a UCB, its membership is a must. However, UCBs are normally not expected to enroll non-banking financial institutions (like investment and financial companies as well as other persons engaged in the business competing with or conflicting with the business of the bank) as their members since it would be in contravention of the state co-operative societies act concerned and will also not be in conformity with the provision of model by-law No. 9. Therefore, **banks should not finance NBFCs, other than those engaged in hire-purchase / leasing**.

(ii) Similarly, admission of non-banking financial companies which are **not engaged exclusively** in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the state cooperative societies act concerned and model bylaw No. 9. It will, therefore, be necessary for the UCBs to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting such leasing / hire purchase companies as members.

6.8.2 Activities eligible for finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities

Within the prescribed credit exposure norms and above stated restrictions, UCBs, with working capital funds aggregating to ₹25 crores and above, may finance the NBFC - Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICC), subject to the following limits:

|      | Type of NBFC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Maximum Limit<br>on Bank Finance                       |  |  |  |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|
| (i)  | NBFC-ICC<br>having not less than 75<br>per<br>cent of their assets in equipment<br>leasing and hire purchase, and 75<br>per<br>cent of their gross income from<br>these two types of activities as per<br>the last audited balance sheet of the | 3 times of the Net Owned<br>Funds (NOF) of the<br>NBFC |  |  |  |
|      | companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                        |  |  |  |
| (ii) | NBFC-ICC carrying out equipment<br>leasing and hire purchase<br>other than<br>(i) above                                                                                                                                                         | 2 times of the Net Owned<br>Funds (NOF) of the<br>NBFC |  |  |  |

#### Note

(i) The maximum limit on bank finance should be within the overall ceiling of borrowing by NBFCs, upto ten times of their NOF.

(ii) Bank finance to leasing concerns should be restricted only to "full payout" leases i.e., those leases where the cost of the asset is fully recovered during the primary lease period itself and further it should cover purchases of only new equipment.

(iii) As a prudent policy, lease rentals due during the period of next five years should alone be taken into account for the purpose of lending.

6.8.3 Activities not Eligible for Finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities

6.8.3.1 The following activities undertaken by non-banking financial companies engaged in hire purchase / leasing activities are not eligible for bank credit. As such, these items should be excluded from the build-up of current assets while arriving at permissible bank finance for all categories of NBFCs :

(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except where specifically permitted;

(ii) Investments made in shares, debentures etc. of a current nature, i.e., stockin-trade;

(iii) Investment in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other entities; and,

(iv) Investments in and inter-corporate loans / deposits to other companies.

6.8.3.2 In respect of items indicated at (a) and (b) above, banks should not make any adjustment in the projected net working capital (NWC). It may be added that the projected NWC represents long-term surplus available to support current operations and, therefore, does not need to be adjusted as a result of changing / pruning the level of current assets while reducing the level of maximum permissible bank finance.

6.8.4 Financing of NBFCs by Scheduled UCBs

6.8.4.1 Scheduled UCBs may rediscount bills discounted by NBFCs arising from sale of commercial vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to normal lending safeguards and the following conditions:

(i) the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturers on dealers only;

(ii) the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from the chassis / engine numbers; and,

(iii) before rediscounting the bills, the UCBs should satisfy themselves about the bona- fides and track record of NBFCs which have discounted the bills.

6.8.4.2 Scheduled UCBs may provide finance to NBFCs eligible for bank finance for the purpose of on lending to Small Road and Water Transport Operators (SRWTOs) for purchase of trucks and classify such advances under priority sector, provided the ultimate borrowers (SRWTOs) satisfy the eligibility requirements for being classified under the priority sector.

6.8.4.3 UCBs may finance NBFCs for on-lending to individual farmers and for hire purchase schemes for distribution of agricultural machinery and implements and the same may be reckoned for the purpose of priority sector lending as indirect finance to agriculture.

6.8.4.4 The Scheduled UCBs may extend finance to NBFCs or other financial intermediaries for on-lending to small and micro enterprises (manufacturing as well as service) and classify such finance under priority sector after satisfying that relevant norms at the ultimate borrowal level are complied with.

<span id="page-16-0"></span>6.9 Financing Equipment Leasing and Hire Purchase Financing

Consequent to the Government of India notification dated December 12, 1995 specifying 'Hire Purchase' and 'Equipment Leasing' as forms of business in which it is lawful for a primary cooperative bank to engage, Scheduled UCBs are allowed to undertake these activities. Scheduled UCBs are advised to ensure that:

(i) These activities are undertaken only at select branches of banks.

(ii) These activities are to be treated at par with loans and advances and subject to extant exposure norms on individual / group borrowers.

(iii) The banks should maintain a balanced portfolio of equipment leasing, hire purchase vis-a-vis aggregate credit. Credit exposure to each of these activities should not exceed 5 per cent of total advances.

(iv) The banks undertaking these activities should follow prudent accounting standards. Entire lease rental should not be taken to banks' income account. Only the interest component should be taken to income account. The component representing replacement cost of the asset should be carried to the Balance Sheet in the form of a provision for depreciation.

(v) As a prudent measure, full depreciation should be provided during the primary lease period of the asset.

(vi) Leasing and hire purchase financing extended by scheduled UCBs, departmentally, may be classified as priority sector advances provided the beneficiary satisfies the criteria laid down by RBI for treating such advances as advances to priority sector.

Non Scheduled UCBs, which also desire to undertake these activities should obtain RBI permission.

<span id="page-16-1"></span>6.10 Financing for Agricultural Activities

UCBs are permitted to finance agricultural activities under priority sector subject to the following conditions:

(i) UCBs would provide direct finance only to members (no nominal members) and not through any agency like primary agricultural credit societies and primary land development banks etc.,

(ii) Credit should be extended only after obtaining 'no dues certificate' from the existing credit agencies in the area, and

(iii) Banks should follow the scales of finance and obtain security as per guideline issued by RBI / NABARD.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>6.11 Loans to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)

6.11.1 UCBs may lend to SHGs and JLGs as per their Board approved policy framed according to the prescribed RBI guidelines in this regard.

6.11.2 UCBs may follow the method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending through intermediaries will not be permitted.

6.11.3 The extant limits (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.

6.11.4 Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on individual exposure limits.

6.11.5 The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit may be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the bank's assessment of the credit requirement.

<span id="page-17-1"></span>6.12 Restriction on Advances to Defaulters of Statutory Dues

6.12.1 Under the law, employees' contributions to provident fund deducted from wages of the employees / members, for a period of more than six months and not paid to the Commissioner are a first charge on the assets of the borrowers, in the case of the insolvency / winding up of the borrowing employer. In the circumstances, primary (urban) cooperative banks should safeguard their interest vis-à-vis such statutory dues.

6.12.2 Therefore, banks should satisfy themselves that there are no arrears of Provident Fund and other statutory dues of the borrowers by obtaining a declaration from them that all such dues have been duly paid. Proof in this regard may be called for only in cases where banks have reason to doubt the borrowers' declaration. Even where a proof is required, it is not necessary to insist on a certificate from the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner; production of a receipt evidencing the payment of the dues or a certificate from the auditors of the borrower or any other similar proof may be considered sufficient. In the case of sick units where there are arrears for reasons beyond the control of the borrowers, banks may continue to consider such cases on merits.
