Dear Sir/ Madam,

# **Review of regulatory framework for HFCs and harmonisation of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs**

Please refer to the [circular DOR.NBFC \(HFC\).CC.No.118/03.10.136/2020-21 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11988&Mode=0)  [October 22, 2020.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11988&Mode=0) In terms of para 4 of the above circular, it was advised that further harmonisation of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs will be taken up in a phased manner over the next two years to ensure that the transition is achieved with least disruption.

2. Since the transfer of regulation of HFCs from National Housing Bank (NHB) to Reserve Bank with effect from August 09, 2019, various regulations have been issued treating HFCs as a category of NBFCs. To be consistent with this policy stance and as stated in para 4 of the aforementioned circular, an analysis of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs was undertaken, with an objective of harmonising these regulations, duly considering specialised nature of the HFCs.

3. Accordingly, based on a review of the extant regulations applicable to HFCs prescribed vide Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) Housing [Finance Company \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2021,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) it has been decided to issue revised regulations as detailed in the [Part A of](#page-2-0) **Annex**. As part of the exercise, certain

regulations applicable to NBFCs have also been reviewed and revised regulations are detailed in [Part B of](#page-10-0) **Annex**. The revised regulations shall be applicable with effect from January 01, 2025.

4. The relevant Master Directions – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) Housing [Finance Company \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2021,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) [Non-Banking Financial](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563)  [Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563) and Master Direction – [Reserve Bank of India \(Non-Banking Financial Company–](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12550) Scale [Based Regulation\) Directions, 2023](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12550) are being modified accordingly.

Yours faithfully,

(J. P. Sharma) Chief General Manager

# **Part A**

# **Section I: Guidelines regarding Acceptance of Public Deposits** *(applicable only to HFCs holding CoR to accept/ hold public deposits)*

1. Currently, HFCs accepting public deposits are subject to more relaxed prudential parameters on deposit acceptance as compared to NBFCs. Since the regulatory concerns associated with deposit acceptance are same across all categories of NBFCs, it has been decided to move HFCs towards the regulatory regime on deposit acceptance as applicable to deposit-taking NBFCs and specify uniform prudential parameters as prescribed under Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Companies](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563)  [Acceptance of Public Deposits \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2016.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563) Accordingly, the revised regulations as stated in subsequent paragraphs would be applicable to HFCs accepting or holding public deposits.

## **Maintenance of a minimum percentage of liquid assets**

2. Currently, in terms of Section 29B of the NHB Act, 1987, deposit taking HFCs are required to maintain 13 per cent liquid assets against public deposits held by them. In exercise of powers conferred under Section 29B of NHB Act, 1987, it has now been decided that all deposit taking HFCs shall maintain, on an ongoing basis, liquid assets to the extent of 15 per cent of the public deposits held by them, in a phased manner as specified below:

| Timeline         | Unencumbered<br>approved securities,<br>to be held as a per<br>cent of public<br>deposits | Total liquid assets along with<br>unencumbered approved<br>securities<br>to be held as a per cent<br>of public deposits |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Currently        | 6.50%                                                                                     | 13%                                                                                                                     |
| January 01, 2025 | 8.00%                                                                                     | 14%                                                                                                                     |
| July 01, 2025    | 10%                                                                                       | 15%                                                                                                                     |

# **Safe Custody of Liquid Assets**

<span id="page-2-0"></span>

3. Deposit taking HFCs are required to maintain liquid assets under Section 29B of NHB Act and such liquid assets shall be entrusted for safe custody with specified entities as stated in para 40 of Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030)

[Housing Finance Company \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2021.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) It has been decided that the regulations on safe custody of liquid assets for HFCs shall be aligned with those of NBFCs in the interest of harmonization of regulations. Accordingly, the instructions contained in para 33 of Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Companies](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563)  [Acceptance of Public Deposits \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563)[1](#page-3-0) on *Safe Custody of Liquid Assets / Collection of Interest on SLR Securities* shall, *mutatis-mutandis,* be applicable to deposit taking HFCs; and the existing regulations on *Safe custody of approved securities* as contained in para 40 of [Master Direction –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) Non-Banking Financial Company – [Housing Finance Company \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) shall stand repealed.

17. In terms of Section 29A of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, the investments/ loans/ exposures to subsidiaries, companies in the same group and other HFCs, in excess of 10 per cent of owned fund, is reduced from the owned fund, in order to arrive at Net Owned Fund (NOF) of an HFC. In this context, while arriving at the NOF, investment made by HFC in entities of the same group, either directly or indirectly, for example through an Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), shall be treated in the same manner, provided the funds in the AIF (company) have come from HFC to the extent of 50% or more; or where the beneficial owner in the case of AIF (trust) is the HFC and 50% of the funds in the Trust have come from the HFC.

Reserve Bank Information Technology Private Limited (ReBIT), has framed these specifications and published the same on its website [\(www.rebit.org.in\)](https://www.rebit.org.in/). HFCs acting either as 'Financial Information Provider' or 'Financial Information User' are expected to adopt the technical specifications published by ReBIT, as updated from time to time.
