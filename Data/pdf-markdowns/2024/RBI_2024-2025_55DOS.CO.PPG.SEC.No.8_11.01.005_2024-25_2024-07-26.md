All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks

Madam / Dear Sir,

# **Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)**

Please refer to the [circular DOR \(PCB\).BPD. Cir No. 9/12.05.001/2019-20 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0)  [January 6, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0) on the Supervisory Action Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs).

2. The existing Supervisory Action Framework (SAF) for UCBs has since been reviewed. Accordingly, the revised framework replacing the SAF, under the nomenclature Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework is contained in the enclosed [Annex.](#page-2-0)

3. The PCA Framework shall be applicable to all UCBs under Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories except UCBs under All Inclusive Directions[1.](#page-0-0) Tier 1 UCBs, though not covered under the PCA Framework as of now, shall be subject to enhanced monitoring under the extant supervisory framework. The exemption of Tier 1 UCBs from the PCA Framework shall be reviewed in due course.

4. The objective of the PCA Framework is to enable supervisory intervention at an appropriate time and require the UCBs to initiate and implement remedial measures in a timely manner, to restore their financial health. The PCA Framework does not

<span id="page-0-0"></span><sup>1</sup> UCBs under All Inclusive Directions (AID) shall continue to be monitored as hitherto including with respect to the conditions under AID. A suitable transition time shall be provided to such UCBs for compliance with the provisions of the PCA Framework, as and when these come out of AID.

preclude RBI from taking any other action as it deems fit at any time, in addition to the corrective actions prescribed in the Framework.

5. The provisions of the PCA Framework will be effective from April 1, 2025.

6. UCBs which are currently subject to supervisory actions on the basis of [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0)  [DOR \(PCB\).BPD. Cir No. 9/12.05.001/2019-20 dated January 6, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11779&Mode=0) referred above will continue to be governed by the restrictions imposed on them. Such UCBs will be considered for an exit from SAF or to be placed under PCA on a case-by-case basis by the Reserve Bank of India.

7. A copy of this circular should be placed before the Board of Directors of your bank in its next meeting and a confirmation thereof should be sent to the office of the Senior Supervisory Manager concerned.

8. With effect from April 1, 2025, instructions contained in this circular shall supersede all earlier instructions issued on SAF.

Yours faithfully,

(Tarun Singh) Chief General Manager

## **PCA Framework for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks**

- A. Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability will be the key areas for monitoring in the revised PCA Framework.
- B. Indicators to be tracked for Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability would be CRAR, Net NPA Ratio (percentage of net NPA to net advances) and net profit, respectively.
- C. The PCA Framework would apply to all Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4, based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators.
- D. Breach of any risk threshold (as detailed under) may result in invocation of PCA.

- E. A bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Reported/Audited Annual Financial Results and/or the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. However, RBI may impose PCA on any bank during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant. Although supervisory action taken will primarily be based on the criteria specified under the PCA Framework, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking appropriate supervisory action in case stress is noticed in other important indicators/parameters or in case of serious governance issues. Also, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking any supervisory action other than those indicated in this circular, based on the merits of each case.
- F. Exit from PCA and Withdrawal of Restrictions under PCA Once a bank is placed under PCA, taking the bank out of PCA Framework and/or withdrawal of restrictions imposed under the PCA Framework will be considered: a) if no breaches in risk thresholds in any of the parameters are observed as per four continuous quarterly financial statements, one of which should be Audited Annual Financial Statement (subject to assessment by RBI); and b) based on supervisory comfort of the RBI, including an assessment on sustainable improvement in key financials of the bank.
- G.When a bank is placed under PCA, one or more of the following corrective actions may be prescribed:
