### **1. INTRODUCTION**

Banks, with their vast branch network throughout the length and breadth of the country, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an important role to play in providing credit to the housing sector.

#### **2. VARIOUS REGULATIONS**

While formulating their policies, banks have to take into account the following RBI guidelines and ensure that bank credit is used for production, construction activities and not for activities connected with speculation in real estate.

#### **(A) ACQUISITION OF LAND**

Bank finance can be granted only for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is obtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, with the help of bank finance or otherwise, within such period as may be laid down by the banks themselves.

# **(B) CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDING / READY-BUILT HOUSE**

**(i)** Banks may grant loans to individuals for purchase/construction of dwelling unit per family and loans for repairs to the damaged dwelling units of families.

**(ii)** Banks may extend finance to a person who already owns a house in town/village where he resides, for buying/ constructing a second house in the same or other town/ village for the purpose of self-occupation.

**(iii)** Banks may extend finance for purchase of a house by a borrower who proposes to let it out on rental basis on account of his posting outside the headquarters or because he has been provided accommodation by his employer.

**(iv)** Banks may extend finance to a person who proposes to buy an old house where he is presently residing as a tenant.

**(v)** Banks may finance for construction meant for improving the conditions in slum areas for which credit may be extended directly to the slum-dwellers on the guarantee of the Government, or indirectly to them through the State Governments.

**(vi)** Banks may provide credit for slum improvement schemes to be implemented by Slum Clearance Boards and other public agencies.

**(vii)** Banks are advised to also adhere to the following conditions, in the light of the observations of Delhi High Court on unauthorized construction:

(a) In cases where the applicant owns a plot/land and approaches the banks/FIs for a credit facility to construct a house, a copy of the sanctioned plan by competent authority in the name of a person applying for such credit facility must be obtained by the Banks/FIs before sanctioning the home loan.

(b) An affidavit-cum-undertaking must be obtained from the person applying for such credit facility that he shall not violate the sanctioned plan, construction shall be strictly as per the sanctioned plan and it shall be the sole responsibility of the executants to obtain completion certificate within 3 months of completion of construction, failing which the bank shall have the power and the authority to recall the entire l
