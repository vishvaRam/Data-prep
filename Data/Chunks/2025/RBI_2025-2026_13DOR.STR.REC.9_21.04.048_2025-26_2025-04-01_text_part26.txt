lows and financials post the earlier restructuring, if any. The date as on which the latest balance sheet is drawn up should not precede the date of restructuring by more than 18 months. In case the latest audited balance sheet is not available the shares are to be collectively valued at Re.1 per company.

26.2.3 In the case of conversion of debt into equity, the 'reference date' shall be the date on which the bank approves the restructuring scheme. In the case of conversion of convertible securities into equity, the 'reference date' shall be the date on which the bank approves the conversion of the convertible securities into equities.

## 27. Restructuring of frauds/willful defaulters

Borrowers who have committed frauds/ malfeasance/ willful default will remain ineligible for restructuring. However, in cases where the existing promoters are replaced by new promoters<sup>24</sup> , and the borrower company is totally delinked from such erstwhile promoters/management, lenders may take a view on restructuring such accounts based on their viability, without prejudice to the continuance of criminal action against the erstwhile promoters/management.

<sup>24</sup> New promoters must satisfy the conditions specified at paragraph 22.1 (a), (b) and (c) above.

## PART C – Miscellaneous

## 28. Wilful Defaulters

28.1 Instructions regarding treatment of Wilful Defaulters are contained in our Master Direction DoR.FIN.REC.No.31/20.16.003/2024-25 dated July 30, 2024 on 'Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters' (as updated from time to time). Banks are required to strictly adhere to these guidelines.

28.2 In addition to these instructions and with a view to ensuring better corporate governance structure in companies and ensuring accountability of independent/professional directors, promoters, auditors, etc. henceforth, the following prudential measures will be applicable:

a) The provisioning in respect of existing loans/exposures of banks to companies having director/s (other than nominee directors of government/financial institutions brought on board at the time of distress), whose name/s appear more than once in the list of wilful defaulters, will be 5% in cases of standard accounts; if such account is classified as NPA, it will attract accelerated provisioning as under:


b) This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures to such borrowers are likely to be higher.

#### 29. Dissemination of Information

29.1 Banks may seek explanation from advocates who wrongly certify as to clear legal titles in respect of assets or valuers who overstate the security value, by negligence or connivance, and if no reply/satisfactory clarification is received from them within one month, they may report their names to IBA. The IBA may circulate the names of such advocates/valuers among its members for consideration before availing of their services in future. The IBA would create a central registry for this purpose.

## 30. Bank Loans for Financing Promoters' Contribution

30.1 In terms of extant instructions on *Bank Loans for Financing Promoters Contribution* as consolidated in our Master Circular DBOD.No.Dir.BC.16/13.03.00/2014-15 dated July 1, 2015 on 'Loans and Advances – Statutory and Other Restrictions', the promoters' contribution towards the equity capital of a company should come from their own resources and banks should not normally grant advances to take up shares of other companies.

30.2 It has been decided that banks can extend finance to 'specialized' entities established for acquisition of troubled companies subject to the general guidelines applicable to advances against shares/debentures/bonds as contained in the above-mentioned Master Circular and other regulatory and statutory exposure limits. The lenders should, however, assess the risks associated with such financing and ensure that these entities are adequately capitalized, and debt equity ratio for such entity is not more than 3:1.

30.3 In this connection, a 'specialized' entity will be a body corporate exclusively set up for the purpose of taking over and turning around troubled companies and promoted by individuals or/and institutional promoters (including Government) having professional expertise in turning around 'troubled companies' and eligible to make investments in the industry/segment to which the target asset belonged.
