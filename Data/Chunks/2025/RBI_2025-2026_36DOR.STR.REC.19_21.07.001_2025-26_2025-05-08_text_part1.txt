#### **Index**



#### **Chapter I: Preliminary**

#### <span id="page-2-1"></span><span id="page-2-0"></span>1. **Preamble**

Reserve Bank is statutorily mandated to operate the credit system of the country to its advantage. In this endeavour, Reserve Bank encourages innovation in the financial systems, products and credit delivery methods while ensuring orderly growth, financial stability and protection of depositors' and borrowers' interest. Certain concerns had emerged around the methods of designing, delivering and servicing digital credit products, which if not mitigated, may impact the borrower's confidence in the digital lending ecosystem. The concerns primarily relate to unbridled engagement of third parties, mis-selling, breach of data privacy, unfair business conduct, charging of exorbitant interest rates, and unethical recovery practices. To address these concerns, pursuant to the recommendations made by the "Working Group on Digital Lending", the Reserve Bank has, from time to time, issued guidelines to its regulated entities on digital lending. These Directions consolidate the earlier instructions along with certain new measures for arrangements involving Lending Service Providers partnering with multiple regulated entities as mentioned under para 6, and for creation of a directory of digital lending apps as mentioned under para 17 of these Directions.

Accordingly, in exercise of powers conferred by sections 21, 35A and 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, sections 45JA, 45L and 45M of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, sections 30A and 32 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, section 6 of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and section 11 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, the Reserve Bank of India being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest to do so, hereby issues these Directions hereinafter specified.
