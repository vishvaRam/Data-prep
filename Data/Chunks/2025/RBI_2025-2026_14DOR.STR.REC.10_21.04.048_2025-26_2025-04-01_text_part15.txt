e of serious credit impairment and such assets should be straightway classified as a doubtful / loss asset as appropriate. Erosion in the value of security can be reckoned as significant when the realizable value of the security is less than 50 per cent of the value assessed by the bank or accepted by RBI at the time of last inspection, as the case may be. Such NPAs may be straightaway classified under doubtful category and provisioning should be made as applicable to doubtful assets.

### **5. Classification of credit facilities under consortium**

**In certain cases of consortium accounts, though the record of recovery in the account with a member bank may suggest that the account is a NPA, the banks submit that, at times, the borrower has deposited adequate funds with the consortium leader / member of the consortium and the bank's share is due for receipt. In such cases, will it be in order for the member bank to classify the account as 'standard' in its books?**

Asset classification of accounts under consortium should be based on the record of recovery of the individual member banks and other aspects having a bearing on the recoverability of the advances. Where the remittances by the borrower under consortium lending arrangements are pooled with one bank and / or where the bank receiving remittances is not parting with the share of other member banks, the account will be treated as not serviced in the books of the other member banks, and therefore, be treated as NPA. The banks participating in the consortium should, therefore, arrange to get their share of recovery transferred from the lead bank or get an express consent from the lead bank for the transfer of their share of recovery, to ensure proper asset classification in their respective books.

### **6. Appropriation of recoveries - What is the practice to be adopted by banks regarding appropriation of recoveries in NPA accounts?**

In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards Principal or interest due) banks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner.

#### **7. Overdues in other credit facilities - There are instances where banks park the dues from a borrower in respect of devolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account, irrespective of whether the borrower's credit facilities are regular or not. How to determine when the account in which such dues are parked has become an NPA?**

A number of banks adopt the practice of parking the dues of the borrower in respect of devolved letters of credit and invoked guarantees in a separate account which is not a regular sanctioned facility. As a result these are not reflected in the principal operating account of the borrower. This renders application of the prudential norms for identification of NPAs difficult. It is, therefore, advised that if the debts arising out of devolvement of letters of credit or invoked guarantees are parked in a separate account, the balance outstanding in that account also should be treated as a part of the borrower's principal operating account for the purpose of application of prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning.

#### **8. Treatment of loss assets - An NPA account will be classified as a loss asset only when there is no security in the account or where there is considerable erosion in the realisable value of the security in the account. What can be termed as a 'considerable' erosion for the account to be classified as a loss asset?**

If the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank / approved valuers / RBI is less than 10 per cent of the outstanding in the borrowal accounts, the existence of security should be ignored and the asset should be straightaway classified as loss asset. It may be either written off after obtaining necessary permission from the competent authority as per the Co-operative Societies Act / Rules, or fully provided for by the bank.

**9. Valuation of Security - A major source of divergence in provisioning requirement was the realisable value of the primary and collateral security. Can uniform guidelines be prescribed for adoption in this area, at least for large value accounts?**

With a view to bringing down divergence arising out of difference in assessment of the value of security it has been decided that in cases of NPAs with balance of â‚¹10 lakh and above :

a) The current assets and their valuation are looked into at the time of Statutory Audit / Concurrent audit. However, in order to enhance the reliability on stock valuations, stock audit at annual intervals by external agencies could be considered in case of larger advances. The cut off limit and the names of the external agencies may be finalised by the Board.

b) Collaterals such as immovable properties charged in favour of the bank should
