**Preamble:** The District Level Review Committee (DLRC), a district level forum under the aegis of Lead Bank Scheme, primarily aims at facilitating stakeholders to undertake review of the district level credit plans and to devise workable solutions for enhancing flow of credit to deserving sectors, besides serving as a platform for Public Representatives to share their valuable feedback for improvising strategy.

**Objectives:** DLRC forum shall function with the objective of evaluating the progress made in the implementation of Schemes included in District Credit Plan/ Annual Action Plan*,* identifying problem areas and devising suitable remedial steps. The forum shall act as a platform for public representatives to share their views and opinions on credit needs of the districts and issues and concerns relating to banking services etc. While the objective of the DCC is to serve as a coordination and implementation forum, the DLRC is expected to serve as a review forum.

**Composition:** The DLRC forum shall be chaired by the District Collector/ District Magistrate and attended by all members of the District Consultative Committee (DCC). Public representatives (MPs/ MLAs/ Zilla Panchayat Chiefs) shall invariably invited to DLRC meetings. The forum may also have representatives of State Minority Commission, SC/ ST Corporation and representatives of the group of beneficiaries of rural lending. The forum may also consider inviting people with the expertise in the fields, such as progressive farmers and local industrialists as special invitees.

The forum shall also undertake review of lending to priority sectors, Government Sponsored Schemes, performance of banks under various micro insurance and investment schemes launched by the Govt. of India.

As the DLRC forum has public representatives as members who are well versed with the ground realities, their views and opinions on the credit needs of the district may be obtained and the same may be considered during the preparation of Potential Linked Plan (PLP) by NABARD. Responses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly.
