e like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. which are necessities for LDMs to discharge their core responsibilities may be provided to their office without exception. Officers of appropriate level, attitude and possessing requisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it is suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs to facilitate closer liaison with bank officials, district administration officials as

<sup>1</sup> Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively involved and monitored at various fora of LBS, particularly at the DCC level. Focus should be on development of skills to enhance credit absorption capacity in the area and renewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs should design specific programmes for each district/ block, keeping in view the skill mapping and the potential of the region for necessary skill training and skill up gradation of the rural youth in the district.

also to organise/ attend various financial literacy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist officer/ assistant for data entry/ analysis is a common and major issue faced by LDMs. Liberty to hire the services of skilled computer operator/s may be given to the LDMs to overcome the shortage of staff in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM's office. Further, for successful functioning of the LBS, we expect Lead Banks to go the extra mile to provide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these critical field functionaries. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings of the DCC and District Level Review Committee (DLRC) and periodical meetings of DDM/ LDO/ Government officials for resolving outstanding issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the following:

- i) Monitoring the implementation of the District Credit Plan
- ii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by banks
- iii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches of banks
- iv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials with participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)
- v) Arranging for quarterly awareness and feedback public meetings, grievance redressal, etc.

#### **2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal**

The LDM should convene a quarterly public meeting at various locations in the district, in coordination with the LDO of RBI, banks having presence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness on the various banking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback from the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such meetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.

## **2.2.6 District Level Review Committee Meetings**

DLRC meetings are chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of the DCC. Public Representatives, i.e., Local MPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings. The DLRC meetings should be convened by the Lead Banks at least once in a quarter. The DLRC is a forum to review the pace and quality of implementation of various programmes under the LBS in the district. Hence, association of non-officials is considered useful. Public representatives (MPs/ MLAs / Zilla Panchayat Chiefs) shall invariably be invited to DLRC meetings. Therefore, Lead Banks should fix the date of DLRC meetings with due regard to the convenience of the representatives of the public, i.e., MPs/MLAs etc., to invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in their districts, such as opening of new banking outlets, distribution of Kisan Credit Cards (KCCs), Self Help Group (SHG) credit linkage programmes, etc. Responses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly. The forum may also have representatives of State Minority Commission, SC/ST Corporation and representatives of the group of beneficiaries of rural lending. The forum may also consider inviting people with expertise in fields, such as progressive farmers and local industrialists as special invitees. The follow up of the DLRC's decisions is required to be discussed in the DCC meetings.

A compendium of instructions outlining the salient features of DLRC forum is given at **[Annex](#page-69-0) V**.

#### **2.2.7 DCC/ DLRC meetings- Annual Calendar of Meetings**

i) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial banks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find solutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is necessary that all the members participate and deliberate in these meetings. On a review of the DCC/ DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt/ non-receipt of intimation of the date of meetings, clash of dates with other events, commonality of d
