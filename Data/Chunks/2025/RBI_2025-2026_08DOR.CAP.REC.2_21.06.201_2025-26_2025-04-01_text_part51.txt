# **8.5 Measurement of Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange Risk**

The bank's net open position in each currency should be calculated by summing:

- The net spot position (i.e., all asset items less all liability items, including accrued interest, denominated in the currency in question);
- The net forward position (i.e., all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid under forward foreign exchange transactions, including currency futures and the principal on currency swaps not included in the spot position);
- Guarantees (and similar instruments) that are certain to be called and are likely to be irrecoverable;
- Net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting bank);
- Depending on accounting conventions in different countries, any other item representing a profit or loss in foreign currencies;
- The net delta-based equivalent of the total book of foreign currency options

Foreign exchange open positions and gold open positions are at present risk-weighted at 100 per cent. Thus, capital charge for market risks in foreign exchange and gold open position is 9 per cent. These open positions, **limits or actual whichever is higher**, would continue to attract capital charge at 9 per cent. This capital charge is in addition to the capital charge for credit risk on the on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items pertaining to foreign exchange and gold transactions.

## **8.6 Measurement of Capital Charge for Credit Default Swap (CDS) in the Trading Book**

## **8.6.1 General Market Risk**

A credit default swap does not normally create a position for general market risk for either the protection buyer or protection seller. However, the present value of premium payable / receivable is sensitive to changes in the interest rates. In order to measure the interest rate risk in premium receivable / payable, the present value of the premium can be treated as a notional position in Government securities of relevant maturity. These positions will attract appropriate capital charge for general market risk. The protection buyer / seller will treat the present value of the premium payable / receivable equivalent to a short / long notional position in Government securities of relevant maturity.

# **8.6.2 Specific Risk for Exposure to Reference Entity**

A CDS creates a notional long / short position for specific risk in the reference asset / obligation for protection seller / protection buyer. For calculating specific risk capital charge, the notional amount of the CDS and its maturity should be used. The specific risk capital charge for CDS positions will be as per Tables below.

# **8.6.2.1 Specific Risk Capital Charges for Positions Hedged by CDS[99](#page-106-0)**

(i) Banks may fully offset the specific risk capital charges when the values of two legs (i.e., long and short in CDS positions) always move in the opposite direction and broadly to the same extent. This would be the case when the two legs consist of **completely identical CDS**. In these cases, no specific risk capital requirement applies to both sides of the CDS positions.

(ii) Banks may offset 80 per cent of the specific risk capital charges when the value of two legs (i.e., long and short) always moves in the opposite direction but not broadly to the same extent. This would be the case when a long cash position is hedged by a credit default swap and there is an exact match in terms of the reference / deliverable obligation, and the maturity of both the reference / deliverable obligation and the CDS. In addition, key features of the CDS (e.g., credit event definitions, settlement mechanisms) should not cause the price movement of the CDS to materially deviate from the price movements of
