e fixed on a realistic basis taking into account the repaying capacity of the borrower.

(ii) In order to make housing finance affordable, banks may consider fixing the instalments on a graduated basis, if there is reasonable expectation of growth in the income of the borrower in the coming years. Graduated basis means fixing lower repayment instalments in the initial years and gradually increasing the instalment amount in subsequent years coinciding with expected increase in income in subsequent years.

4.8.1 Aggregate exposure of a UCB to residential mortgages (housing loans to individuals), other than those eligible to be classified as priority sector, shall not exceed 25 per cent of its total loans and advances.

4.8.2 Aggregate exposure of a UCB to real estate sector, excluding housing loans to individuals, shall not exceed five per cent of its total loans and advances.

4.8.3 The exposure should take into account both fund based and non-fund based facilities.

4.8.4 Working capital loans given by UCBs against hypothecation of construction materials provided to the contractors who undertake comparatively small construction on their own without receiving advance payments as provided for in paragraph 7 of this circular is exempted from the prescribed limit.

4.8.5 Finance extended to the eligible category of borrowers mentioned in paragraph 2 above will only be eligible to be treated as housing finance. While the purpose of the loan shall determine whether the loans granted against the security of immovable property need to be classified as real estate loans, the source of repayment will determine whether the exposure is against commercial real estate. For classification of such loans as Real Estate / Commercial Real Estate, UCBs may be guided by the instructions contained in [Annex 1.](#page-10-0) As loans to the residential housing projects under the Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Sector exhibit lesser risk and volatility than the CRE Sector taken as a whole, a separate sub-sector called 'Commercial Real Estate– Residential Housing' (CRE-RH) has been carved out from the CRE Sector. CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption) under CRE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate. However, integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, etc.) can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.

4.8.6 UCBs shall not exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real estate, commercial real estate loans even for the funds obtained from higher financing agencies and refinance from National Housing Bank.
