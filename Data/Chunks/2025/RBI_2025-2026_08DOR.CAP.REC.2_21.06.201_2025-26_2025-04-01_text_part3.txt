# **3.4 Capital Adequacy at Group / Consolidated Level**

3.4.1 All banking and other financial subsidiaries except subsidiaries engaged in insurance and any non-financial activities (both regulated and unregulated) should be fully consolidated for the purpose of capital adequacy. This would ensure assessment of capital adequacy at the group level, taking into account the risk profile of assets and liabilities of the consolidated subsidiaries.

3.4.2 The insurance and non-financial subsidiaries / joint ventures / associates etc. of a bank **should not** be consolidated for the purpose of capital adequacy. The equity and other regulatory capital investments in the insurance and non-financial subsidiaries will be deducted from consolidated regulatory capital of the group. Equity and other regulatory capital investments in the unconsolidated insurance and non-financial entities of banks (which also include joint ventures / associates of the parent bank) will be treated in terms of paragraphs 4.4.9 and 5.13.6 respectively.

3.4.3 All regulatory adjustments indicated in paragraph 4.4 are required to be made to the consolidated capital of the banking group as indicated therein.

3.4.4 Minority interest (i.e., non-controlling interest) and other capital issued out of consolidated subsidiaries as per paragraph 3.4.1 that is held by third parties will be recognized in the consolidated regulatory capital of the group subject to certain conditions as stipulated in paragraph 4.3.

3.4.5 Banks should ensure that majority owned financial entities that are not consolidated for capital purposes and for which the investment in equity and other instruments eligible for regulatory capital status is deducted, meet their respective regulatory capital requirements. In case of any shortfall in the regulatory capital requirements in the unconsolidated entity, the shortfall shall be fully deducted from the Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

3.4.6 It is clarified that group/ consolidated level capital adequacy would also mean application of consolidated capital adequacy norms to the Non-Operative Financial Holding Company (NOFHC) after consolidating the relevant entities held by it in terms of paragraph 3.1(a) above, in conjunction with the Guidelines for consolidated accounting and other quantitative methods to facilitate consolidated supervision issued vide [circular dated DBOD.No.BP.BC.72](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=1071&Mode=0)  [/21.04.018/2001-02 dated February 25, 2003](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=1071&Mode=0)[4](#page-9-1).

# **4.1 General**

Banks shall maintain a minimum Pillar 1 Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 9% on an on-going basis (other than capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer etc.). The Reserve Bank will take into account the relevant risk factors and the internal capital adequacy assessments of each bank to ensure that the capital held by a bank is commensurate with the bank's overall risk profile. This would include, among others, the effectiveness of the bank's risk management systems in identifying, assessing / measuring, monitoring and managing various risks including interest rate risk in the banking book, liquidity risk, concentration risk and residual risk. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank will consider prescribing a higher level of minimum capital ratio for each bank under the Pillar 2 framework on the basis of their respective risk profiles and their risk management systems. Further, in terms of the Pillar 2 requirements, banks are expected
