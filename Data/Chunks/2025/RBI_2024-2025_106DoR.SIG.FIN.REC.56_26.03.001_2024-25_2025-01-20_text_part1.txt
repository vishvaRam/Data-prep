## <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Paragraph 15 - Settlement of dues payable by the borrower**

15.1 Every ARC shall frame a Board-approved policy for settlement of dues payable by the borrowers. This policy shall, *inter alia*, cover aspects such as cut-off date for one-time settlement eligibility, permissible sacrifice for various categories of exposures while arriving at the settlement amount, methodology for arriving at the realisable value of the security.

15.2 Settlement with the borrower shall be done only after all possible ways to recover the dues have been examined and settlement is considered as the best option available.

15.3 The Net Present Value (NPV) of the settlement amount should generally be not less than the realizable value of securities. If there is a significant variation between valuation of the securities recorded at the time of acquisition of financial assets and realisable value of the securities assessed at the time of entering into a settlement, reasons thereof shall be duly recorded.

15.4 The settlement amount should preferably be paid in lump sum. Where the settlement does not envisage payment of the entire amount agreed upon in one instalment, the proposals should be in line with and supported by an acceptable business plan (where applicable), projected earnings and cash flows of the borrower.

15.5 Settlement of accounts pertaining to a borrower having aggregate value of more than ₹1 crore in terms of outstanding principal in the books of transferor/s at the time of acquisition by the ARC[1](#page-1-1) shall be done as per Board approved policy, subject to the following:

- b) The Board of Directors including at least two independent directors or a Committee of the Board meeting the prescribed criteria[3,](#page-2-1) shall deliberate on the recommendations of IAC and consider various options available for recovery of dues before deciding whether the option of settlement of dues with the borrower is the best option available under the existing circumstances and the decision, along with detailed rationale, shall be specifically recorded in the minutes of the meeting.

15.6 Settlement of accounts pertaining to a borrower having aggregate value of ₹1 crore or below in terms of principal outstanding in the books of transferor/s at the time of acquisition by the ARC shall be done as per the criteria prescribed by the authority in the Board-approved policy, subject to the following:
