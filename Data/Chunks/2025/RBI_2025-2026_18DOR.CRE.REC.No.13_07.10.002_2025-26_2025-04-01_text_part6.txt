o be supplemented by 'due diligence' on the part of lenders themselves, and to the extent possible, such loans should be limited to only those borrowers whose integrity and reliability were above board. UCBs, therefore, should not depend entirely on the certificates issued by the Chartered Accountants but strengthen their internal controls and the credit risk management system to enhance the quality of their loan portfolio. Needless to say, ensuring end-use of funds by UCBs should form a part of their loan policy document for which appropriate measures should be put in place.

4.14 The following are the illustrative measures that could be taken by the lenders for monitoring and ensuring end-use of funds:

- (i) Meaningful scrutiny of quarterly progress reports / operating statements / balance sheets of the borrowers;
- (ii) Regular inspection of borrowers' assets charged to the lenders as security;
- (iii) Periodic scrutiny of borrowers' books of accounts and the no-lien accounts maintained with other banks;
- (iv) Periodic visits to the assisted units;
- (v) System of periodical stock audit, in case of working capital finance;
- (vi) Periodic comprehensive management audit of the 'Credit' function of the lenders, so as to identify the systemic weaknesses in the credit-administration.

#### 4.15 Penal charges

Reserve Bank has issued various guidelines to the Regulated Entities (REs) to ensure reasonableness and transparency in disclosure of penal interest. The intent of levying penal interest/charges is essentially to inculcate a sense of credit discipline and such charges are not meant to be used as a revenue enhancement tool over and above the contracted rate of interest. UCBs shall comply with the following instructions for charging penal interest/charges on loans:

4.15.1 Penalty, if charged, for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract by the borrower shall be treated as 'penal charges' and shall not be levied in the form of 'penal interest' that is added to the rate of interest charged on the advances. There shall be no capitalisation of penal charges i.e., no further interest computed on such charges. However, this will not affect the normal procedures for compounding of interest in the loan account.

4.15.2 UCBs shall not introduce any additional component to the rate of interest and ensure compliance to these guidelines in both letter and spirit.

4.15.3 UCBs shall formulate a Board approved policy on penal charges or similar charges on loans, by whatever name called.

4.15.4 The quantum of penal charges shall be reasonable and commensurate with the noncompliance of material terms and conditions of loan contract without being discriminatory within a particular loan / product category.

4.15.5 The penal charges in case of loans sanctioned to 'individual borrowers, for purposes other than business', shall not be higher than the penal charges applicable to non-individual borrowers for similar non-compliance of material terms and conditions.

4.15.6 The quantum and reason for penal charges shall be clearly disclosed by UCBs to the customers in the loan agreement and most important terms & conditions / Key Fact Statement (KFS)[1](#page-10-0) as applicable, in addition to being displayed on UCBs website under Interest rates and Service Charges.

4.15.7 Whenever reminders for non-compliance of material terms and conditions of loan are sent to borrowers, the applicable penal charges shall be communicated. Further, any instance of levy of penal charges and the reason therefor shall also be communicated.

4.15.8 UCBs may carry out appropriate revisions in their policy framework and ensure implementation of the above instructions in respect of all the fresh loans availed from April 1, 2024 onwards. In the case of existing loans, the switchover to new penal charges regime shall be ensured on the next review/ renewal date falling on or after April 1, 2024, but not later than June 30, 2024.

4.15.9 In the case of loans to borrowers under priority sector, no penalty should be charged for loans up to ₹25,000.
