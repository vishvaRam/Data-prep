 purchase vis-a-vis aggregate credit. Credit exposure to each of these activities should not exceed 5 per cent of total advances.

(iv) The banks undertaking these activities should follow prudent accounting standards. Entire lease rental should not be taken to banks' income account. Only the interest component should be taken to income account. The component representing replacement cost of the asset should be carried to the Balance Sheet in the form of a provision for depreciation.

(v) As a prudent measure, full depreciation should be provided during the primary lease period of the asset.

Non Scheduled UCBs, which also desire to undertake these activities should obtain RBI permission.

UCBs are permitted to finance agricultural activities subject to the following conditions:

(i) UCBs would provide direct finance only to members (no nominal members) and not through any agency like primary agricultural credit societies and primary land development banks etc.,

(ii) Credit should be extended only after obtaining 'no dues certificate' from the existing credit agencies in the area, and

(iii) Banks should follow the scales of finance and obtain security as per guideline issued by RBI / NABARD.

<span id="page-17-0"></span>6.11 Loans to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)

6.11.1 UCBs may lend to SHGs and JLGs as per their Board approved policy framed according to the prescribed RBI guidelines in this regard.

6.11.2 UCBs may follow the method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending through intermediaries will not be permitted.

6.11.3 The extant limits (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.

6.11.4 Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on individual exposure limits.

6.11.5 The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit may be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the bank's assessment of the credit requirement.

<span id="page-17-1"></span>6.12 Restriction on Advances to Defaulters of Statutory Dues

6.12.1 Under the law, employees' contributions to provident fund deducted from wages of the employees / members, for a period of more than six months and not paid to the Commissioner are a first charge on the assets of the borrowers, in the case of the insolvency / winding up of the borrowing employer. In the circumstances, primary (urban) cooperative banks should safeguard their interest vis-Ã -vis such statutory dues.

6.12.2 Therefore, banks should satisfy themselves that there are no arrears of Provident Fund and other statutory dues of the borrowers by obtaining a declaration from them that all such dues have been duly paid. Proof in this regard may be called for only in cases where banks have reason to doubt the borrowers' declaration. Even where a proof is required, it is not necessary to insist on a certificate from the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner; production of a receipt evidencing the payment of the dues or a certificate from the auditors of the borrower or any other similar proof may be considered sufficient. In the case of sick units where there are arrears for reasons beyond the control of the borrowers, banks may continue to consider such cases on merits.
