# **2.4 Options**

- 2.4.1 The PDI shall not be issued with a 'put option' or 'step-up' option.
- 2.4.2 However, PDI may be issued with a call option subject to following conditions:
	- a) The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at least ten years; and
	- b) Call option shall be exercised only with the prior approval of Department of Regulation (DoR), RBI. While considering the proposals received from banks for exercising the call option, the RBI would, among other things, take into consideration the bank's CRAR position both at the time of exercise of the call option and after exercise of the call option.

## **2.5 Classification**

PDI shall be classified as 'Borrowings' and shown separately in the Balance Sheet.

### **2.6 Rate of interest**

The interest payable to the investors may be either at a fixed rate or at a floating rate referenced to a market determined rupee interest benchmark rate.

## **2.7 Lock-in-Clause**

2.7.1 PDI shall be subjected to a lock-in-clause in terms of which the issuing bank shall not be liable to pay interest, if

- i. the bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI; or
- ii. the impact of such payment results in bank's CRAR falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI;

2.7.2 However, UCBs may pay interest with the prior approval of the DoR, RBI when the impact of such payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR meets the regulatory norm. For this purpose, net loss is defined as either (i) the accumulated loss at the end of the previous financial year or (ii) the loss incurred during the current financial year.

2.7.3 The interest shall not be cumulative.

2.7.4 All instances of invocation of the lock-in-clause should be reported by the issuing UCB to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI.

## **2.8 Seniority of claim**

The claims of the investors of PDI shall be superior to the claims of investors in equity shares and PNCPS but subordinated to the claims of all other creditors and the depositors. Among investors in PDI and outstanding Innovative Perpetual Debt Instruments (IPDI[10](#page-27-0)), the claims shall rank *pari passu* with each other.

## **2.9 Discount**

The PDI shall not be subjected to a progressive discount for capital adequacy purposes since these are perpetual.

## **2.10 Other conditions**

2.10.1 PDI shall be fully paid-up, unsecured and free of any restrictive clauses.

2.10.2 UCBs shall also comply with the terms and conditions, if any, stipulated by other regulatory authorities in regard to issue of the PDI, provided they are not in conflict with the terms and conditions specified in these guidelines. Any instance of conflict shall be brought to the notice of the DoR of RBI for seeking confirmation of the eligibility of the instrument for inclusion in Tier I capital.

# **2.11 Compliance with Reserve Requirements**

The total amount raised by a UCB through the issue of PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements. However, the amount collected from members / prospective investors and pending issue of PDI, shall be reckoned as liability for the purpose of calculating the net demand and time liabilities and shall, accordingly, attract reserve requirements. Such amounts pending issue of PDI, shall not be reckoned for calculation of capital funds.

## **2.12 Reporting Requirements**

UCBs issuing PDI shall submit a report to the concerned RO of DoS, RBI giving details of the amount raised, including the terms and conditions of issue together with a copy of the Prospectus / Offer Document, soon after the issue is completed.

## **2.13 Investments in PDI and Advances for Purchase of PDI**

UCBs shall not grant any loan or advance to any person for purchasing their PDI or PDI of other banks. UCBs shall not invest in PDI issued by other banks (except when the PDI are issued as a part of revival plan of a UCB as mentioned in Para 1 above) and shall not grant advances against the security of PDI issued by them or other banks.

# **B. Long Term Subordinated Bonds (LTSB) eligible for inclusion in Lower Tier II capital**

UCBs are permitted to issue LTSB to their members, or any other person residing within their area of operation. The amounts raised through LTSB shall comply with the following terms and conditions to be eligible for inclusion in Lower Tier II capital.
