# **1. Background**

The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD), Government of India launched the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) by restructuring Swarnajayanti Gram Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) with effect from 01st April 2013 [\(RBI Circular No. RBI/2012-13/559 dated 27](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8075&Mode=0)  [June 2013\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8075&Mode=0). NRLM was renamed as DAY-NRLM (Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihoods Mission) w.e.f. March 29, 2016. The DAY-NRLM is the flagship program of Government of India for promoting poverty reduction through building strong institutions of the poor, particularly women, and enabling these institutions to access a range of financial services and livelihoods. DAY-NRLM adopts a demand driven approach, enabling the States to formulate their own State specific poverty reduction action plans. The key features of DAY-NRLM have been furnished in [Annex I.](#page-11-0)

# **2. Women SHGs and their Federations**

2.1 DAY-NRLM promotes affinity-based women Self Help Groups (SHGs). However, only in case of groups to be formed with persons with disabilities and other special categories like elders and transgenders, DAY-NRLM may have both men and women in the Self-Help Groups.

2.2 Women SHGs under DAY-NRLM consist of 10-20 members. In case of special SHGs i.e., groups in the difficult areas, groups with disabled persons, and groups formed in remote tribal areas, this number may be a minimum of 5 members.

2.3 Federations of Self Help Groups formed at village, gram panchayat, cluster or higher level may be registered under appropriate Acts prevailing in their respective states.

# **Financial Assistance to the SHGs**

# **3. Revolving Fund**

DAY-NRLM, MoRD, will provide Revolving Fund (RF) support as corpus ranging between ₹20,000 - ₹30,000 per SHG to strengthen their institutional and financial management capacity and build a good credit history within the group. SHGs in existence for a minimum period of 3/6 months and follow the norms of good SHGs known as 'Panchasutras', *viz*., regular meetings, regular savings, regular internal lending, regular recoveries and maintenance of proper books of accounts, and which have not received any RF earlier will be eligible for such support.

# **4. Capital Subsidy**

No capital subsidy would be sanctioned to any SHG under DAY-NRLM.

# **5. Community Investment Support Fund (CIF)**

CIF will be provided by MoRD to the SHGs promoted under DAY-NRLM in all blocks and will be routed through the village level/cluster level federations, to be maintained in perpetuity by the federations. The CIF may be used by the federations to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to undertake common/collective socio-economic activities.
