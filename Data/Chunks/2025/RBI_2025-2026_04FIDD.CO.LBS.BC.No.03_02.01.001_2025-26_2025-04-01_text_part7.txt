for sensitisation and understanding of the LBS.

ii) Staff at the operational level of banks and government agencies associated with implementation of the LBS need to be aware of the latest developments and emerging opportunities. There is need for staff sensitisation/ training/seminars, etc., at periodic intervals on an ongoing basis.

## **3. Implementation of Lead Bank Scheme**

## **3.1 Preparation of credit plans**

Planning plays an important role in the implementation of the LBS and a bottom-up approach is adopted to map the existing potential for development. Under LBS, planning starts with identifying block-wise/ activity-wise potential estimated for various sectors.

# **3.2 Potential Linked Credit Plans**

i) Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) are a step towards decentralized credit planning with the basic objective of mapping the existing potential for development through bank credit. PLPs take into account the long-term physical potential, availability of infrastructure support, marketing facilities and policies/ programmes of Government etc. NABARD to take measures to ensure that PLPs should be more focussed and implementable so that banks can utilize them more gainfully while preparing the Branch Credit Plan (BCP). PLPs should emphasise on promotion of sustainable agricultural practices suitable to local conditions. While preparing the PLPs, the focus must be on identifying processes and projects that:

- a. reduce carbon foot-print,
- b. prevent overuse of fertilizers,
- c. ensure efficient utilisation of water, and
- d. address agricultural pollution issues.

The plans must also focus on promoting innovative farming systems, such as, organic farming, bio dynamic farming, permaculture and sustainable small-scale farming, as also promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and Farmers' Markets. Such initiatives must be supported by appropriate investments and project finance frameworks.

ii) A pre-PLP meeting is convened by the LDM during June every year to be attended by banks, Government agencies, etc., to reflect their views and concerns regarding credit potential (sector/activity-wise) and deliberate on major financial and socioeconomic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP. The DDM of NABARD makes a presentation in this meeting outlining the major requirements of information for preparing the PLP for the following year. The preparation of PLP for the next year is to be completed by August every year to enable the State Government to factor in the PLP projections.

iii) The procedure for preparing the District Credit Plan is as follows:

- a) Controlling Offices of commercial banks including SFBs, WOS of Foreign Banks and Head Office of RRBs and DCCB/LDB circulate the accepted blockwise/activity-wise potential to all their branches for preparing the BCP by their respective branch managers. Banks should ensure that the exercise of preparation of branch/block plans is completed in time by all branches so that the Credit Plans become operational on time.
- b) A special BLBC meeting is convened for each block where the BCPs are discussed and aggregated to form the Block Credit Plan. The DDM and the LDM guide the BLBC in finalizing the plan, ensuring that the Block Credit Plan is in tune with the potentials identified activity-wise, including in respect of Government Sponsored Schemes.
- c) All the Block Credit Plans of the district are aggregated by the LDM to form the District Credit Plan (DCP). This plan indicates an analytical assessment of the credit needs of the district to be deployed by all the financial institutions operating in the district and the total quantum of funds to be earmarked as credit by all the financial institutions for a new financial year. The Zonal/Controlling Offices of banks, while finalizing their business plans for the year, should take into account the commitments made in the DCP which should be ready well in time before the performance budgets are finalized.
- d) The DCP is then placed before the DCC by the Lead District Manager for final acceptance/approval. All the DCPs are eventually aggregated into a State Level Credit Plan to be prepared by the SLBC Convenor Bank and launched by the 1st of April every year.
- e) The corporate business targets for branches, blocks, districts and states may be aligned with the Annual Credit Plans (ACP) to ensure better implementation. The Controlling Offices of the banks in each state should synchronize their internal business plans with the ACP.

# **3.3 Monitoring the Performance of Credit Plans**

The performance of the credit plans is reviewed in the various fora created under the Lead Bank Scheme as shown below:


## **Monitoring of LBS by RBI - Monitoring Information System (MIS)**

i) Data on ACP is an important element to review the flow of credit in the State. ACP formats are aligned with the extant reporting guidelines on priority sector lending
