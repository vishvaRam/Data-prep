## <span id="page-1-0"></span>**Master Circular – Disbursement of Government Pension by Agency Banks**

# **Introduction**

Payment of pension to retired government employees, including payment of basic pension, increased dearness relief (DR), and other benefits, as and when announced by the governments, is governed by the relevant schemes prepared by concerned Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments. This Master Circular consolidates important instructions on the subject issued by the Reserve Bank of India till March 31, 2025 [\(listed in Appendix\)](#page-8-0). It does not replace or supersede any existing government instructions on the matter. The instructions issued by Pension Sanctioning Authority of the Central and State Governments and circulated by RBI in the past will continue to remain in operation subject to changes being made by the competent authority. In case of any doubt or apparent contradiction, agency banks may be guided by the relevant government instructions. Contents of various circulars issued in this connection by the Reserve Bank of India are summarized hereunder.

## **General Instructions**

## **Government orders on DR, etc. on websites**

2. In order to obviate the time lag between issue of DR orders and payment of DR to the beneficiary and to render expeditious service to senior citizens, the procedure of forwarding related government orders in respect of dearness relief etc. to pension disbursing agency banks has been discontinued. Agency banks may, therefore, act on the copies of government orders provided by government to them through post, fax, e-mails or by accessing from the government websites and authorize their pension paying branches to make payments to the pensioners immediately.

## **Prompt implementation of Government's instructions by agency banks**

3. All agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines/ instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and take necessary action immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI.

# **Timing of pension disbursement by agency banks**

4. The pension paying banks will credit the pension amount in the accounts of the pensioners based on the instructions given by respective Pension Paying Authorities.

# **Refund of excess pension payment to Government**

5. Whenever any excess/overpayment is detected, the entire amount thereof should be credited to the Government account in lump sum immediately, when the excess/overpayment is due to an error on the part of the agency bank. This action is independent of recovery from the pensioner. Agency banks are requested to seek guidance from respective Pension Sanctioning Authorities regarding the process to be followed for recovery of excess pension paid to the pensioners, if any.

6. If the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, banks may take up the matter with the full particulars of the cases with respective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise and the government authority's acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank's record. The banks may take up such cases with government departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India.

# **Withdrawal of pension by old/ sick/ disabled/ incapacitated pensioners**

7. In order to take care of problems/ difficulties faced by sick and disabled pensioners in withdrawal of pension / family pension from the banks, agency banks may categorize such pensioners as under:

- (a) Pensioner who is too ill to sign a cheque / unable to be physically present in the bank.
- (b) Pensioner who is not only unable to be physically present in the bank but also not even able to put his/her thumb impression on the cheque/ withdrawal form due to certain physical defect /inc
