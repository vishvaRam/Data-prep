shall be monitored under the existing system by the DCC, and
- The districts with CD Ratio less than 20 percent need to be treated on a special footing.

ii) SSCs of the DCC should be set up in the districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent, to monitor the CD Ratio and to draw up Monitorable Action Plans (MAPs) to increase the CD Ratio. The LDM is designated as the Convenor of the SSC which, in addition to the District Co-ordinators of banks functioning in the area, should comprise of the LDO of RBI, the DDM of NABARD, the District Planning Officer or a representative of the Collector duly empowered to take decisions on behalf of the district administration.

The functions of the SSC are as under:

- The SSCs should draw up MAPs for improving the CD Ratio in their districts on a self-set graduated basis.
- For this purpose, the SSC should hold a special meeting immediately after its constitution and based on various ground level parameters, set for itself, a target for increasing the CD Ratio, initially for the current year. It will also, at the same meeting, set a definite time frame to achieve CD Ratio more than 60 percent in annual increments.
- Consequent to the completion of this process, the target and time frame selfset by the SSC should be placed before the DCC for approval.
- The plans for implementation must then be taken up by the SSC and monitored assiduously, once in two months.
- The SSC should report the progress on the implementation of the plan to the DCC on a quarterly basis and through them to the SLBC Convenor.
- Based on the feedback received from the DCC regarding the progress in implementation of the MAPs, a consolidated report should be prepared by the SSC and tabled at all SLBC meetings for discussion/ information.

iii) As regards the districts with CD Ratio less than 20 percent, these are generally located in hilly, desert or inaccessible terrains and/ or those dependent solely on the primary sector and/ or characterized by a breakdown of the law and order machinery. In such areas, conventional methods are not likely to work unless the banking system and the State Government come together in a specially meaningful way.

iv) While the framework for implementation for raising the CD Ratio in these districts will be the same as in the case of districts with CD Ratio below 40 percent (i.e., setting up of SSC etc.), the focus of attention and the level of efforts should be of a much higher scale.

For this,

• All such districts should first be placed in a special category.

- Thereafter, the responsibility for increasing their CD Ratio should be taken by banks and State Governments and the districts should be "adopted" by the District Administration and the Lead Bank jointly.
- While banks would be responsible for credit disbursement, the State Government would be required to give an upfront commitment regarding its responsibilities for creation of identified rural infrastructure together with support in creating an enabling environment for banks to lend and to recover their dues.
- Progress in the special category districts should be monitored at the district level and reported to the corporate offices of the concerned banks.
- The Chairmen/ Managing Directors of banks should give special attention to the CD Ratio in such districts.

## **7. Direct Benefit Transfer**

DBT was rolled out by the Government of India in selected districts in January 2013. It was expanded to other districts subsequently. SLBC Convenor Banks were advised to co-ordinate with the Government authorities to implement DBT. Banks were advised to include the status of the roll-out of DBT as a regular agenda item for discussion in SLBC meetings as part of Financial Inclusion/ DBT implementation. As a prerequisite to the implementation of DBT, every eligible individual should have a bank account. Further, to make disbursements at the doorstep through the ICT-based BC model, banking outlets either through brick & mortar branches or the branchless mode is needed in all villages across the country. Hence, banks have been advised to:

- take steps to complete the opening of bank accounts and seeding of Aadhaar numbers in all bank accounts.
- closely monitor the progress in seeding of Aadhaar number with the bank accounts of beneficiaries.
- put in place a system to provide the beneficiary of the seeding request an acknowledgement and send a confirmation of the seeding of Aadhaar number.
- form a DBT Implementation Co-ordination Committee, along with the State Government department concerned at district level and review the seeding of Aadhaar numbers in bank accounts.
- ensure that district and village wise names and other details of BCs engaged/ other arrangements made by the bank are displayed on the SLBC website.

• set up a Complaint Grievance Redressal mechanism in each bank and nominate a Complaint Redressal Officer in each district, to redress the grievances related to 'seeding of Aadhaar number in bank accou
