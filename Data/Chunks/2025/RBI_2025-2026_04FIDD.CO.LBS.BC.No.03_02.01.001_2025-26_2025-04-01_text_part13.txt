## **10. Expanding and Deepening of Digital Payments Ecosystem**

With a view to expanding and deepening the digital payments ecosystem, the SLBCs/ UTLBCs were advised to identify one district in their respective States/ UTs on a pilot basis, in consultation with banks and stakeholders and allocate it to a bank with significant footprint, which would endeavour to make the district 100% digitally enabled. With this, every individual in the district would be able to make/ receive payments digitally in a safe, secure, quick, affordable and convenient manner. SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were also advised to devise a time bound roadmap for all branches of member banks (Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks, RRBs, SFBs and PBs) located in the identified district(s) for on-boarding merchants/ traders/ businesses/ utility service providers to facilitate fully digital transactions. Further, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were advised to constitute a Sub-Committee on Digital Payments at the SLBC/ UTLBC level. Subsequently, SLBCs/ UTLBCs have been advised to devise a timebound roadmap to cover all the districts in their respective States/UTs and make them 100% digitally enabled.
