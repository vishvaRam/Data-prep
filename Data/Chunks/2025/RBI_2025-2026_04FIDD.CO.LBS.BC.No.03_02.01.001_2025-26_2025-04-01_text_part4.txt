ates, etc., hinder participation of members in these meetings, thus undermining the prime objective of conducting the meetings.

ii) Lead Banks have, therefore, been advised to prepare an Annual Schedule of DCC and DLRC meetings on calendar year basis for all districts, in consultation with the Chairperson of the meetings, LDO of the RBI and Public Representatives in case of DLRC. This yearly calendar should be prepared at the beginning of each year and circulated to all members as advance intimation for blocking future dates to attend the DCC and DLRC meetings and the meetings should be conducted as per the calendar. While preparing the calendar, it should be ensured that DCC and DLRC meetings are **not** held simultaneously. Lead Banks must fix dates of DLRC meetings, taking into account the convenience of the MPs and circulate the agenda papers to MPs well in advance.

#### **2.3 State Level Bankers' Committee**

## **2.3.1 Constitution of SLBC**

i) The State Level Bankers' Committee was constituted in April 1977, as an apex interinstitutional forum to create adequate coordination machinery in all States, on a uniform basis for development of the State. SLBC is chaired by the Chairman/ Managing Director/ Executive Director of the Convenor Bank. It comprises representatives of commercial banks including SFBs, WOS of Foreign Banks, RRBs, PBs, State Cooperative Banks, RBI, NABARD, heads of Government departments including representatives from National Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes, National Horticulture Board, Khadi & Village Industries Commission, etc., and representatives of financial institutions operating in a State, who come together and sort out coordination problems at the policy implementation level. Representatives of various organizations from different sectors of the economy like industry bodies, retail traders, exporters, farmers' unions, etc. are special invitees in the SLBC meetings for discussing their specific problems, if any. SLBC meetings are held on quarterly basis. The responsibility for convening the SLBC meetings would be of the SLBC Convenor Bank of the State.

ii) Recognising that SLBCs, primarily as a committee of bankers at the State level, play an important role in the development of the State, illustrative guidelines on the conduct of SLBC meetings have been issued.

#### **2.3.2 Conduct of SLBC Meetings**

i) SLBC meetings are required to be held regularly at quarterly intervals. The meetings are chaired by the Chairman/ Managing Director/ Executive Director of the Convenor Bank and co-chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary or Development Commissioner of the State concerned. In cases where the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer/Executive Director of the SLBC Convenor Bank is unable to attend SLBC Meetings, the Regional Director/ GM(O-i-C) of the RBI shall co-chair the meetings along with the Additional Chief Secretary/Development Commissioner of the State concerned. A High Level of participation in SLBC/ UTLBC meetings ensures an effective and desired outcome with meaningful discussion on issues of public policy of both the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India.

ii) The Chief Minister/Finance Minister and senior level officers of the State/RBI (of the rank of Deputy Governor / Executive Director) may be invited to attend the SLBC meetings. Further, the State Chief Ministers are encouraged to attend at least one SLBC meeting in a year.

iii) State Level Bankers' Committee meetings should primarily focus on policy issues with participation of only the senior functionaries of the banks/ Government Departments. All routine issues may be delegated to sub-committee(s) of the SLBC. A Steering Sub-committee may be constituted in the SLBC to deliberate on agenda proposals from different stakeholders and finalise a compact agenda for the SLBC meetings. Typically, the sub-committee could consist of SLBC Convenor, RBI & NABARD representatives & senior State Government representative from the concerned department, e.g., Finance/ Institutional Finance and two to three banks having major presence. The sub-committee may be chaired by the Convenor (i.e., generally General Manager) of the SLBC Convenor Bank.

iv) Other issue-specific sub-committees may be constituted as required. The subcommittees may examine the specific issues relating to agriculture, micro, small/medium industries/enterprises, handloom finance, export promotion and financial inclusion, etc., in-depth and devise solutions/recommendations for adoption by the full committee. They are expected to meet more frequently than the SLBC. The composition of the sub-committees and subjects/ specific issues impeding/enabling financial inclusion to be deliberated upon, may vary from State to State depending on the specific problems/issues faced by the States.

v) The secretariat / offices of the SLBC should be sufficiently strengthened to enable the SLBC Convenor Bank to effectively discharge its functions.
