ns deprive the negotiating bank of the right of recourse it has against the drawer under the Negotiable Instruments Act. UCBs should not, therefore, open LCs and purchase / discount / negotiate bills bearing the 'without recourse' clause.

8.10 Accommodation bills should not be purchased / discounted / negotiated by banks. The underlying trade transactions should be clearly identified, and a proper record thereof maintained at the branches conducting the bills business.

8.11 UCBs should be circumspect while discounting bills drawn by front finance companies set up by large industrial groups on other group companies.

8.12 Bills rediscounts should be restricted to usance bills held by other banks. UCBs should not rediscount bills earlier discounted by NBFCs except in respect of bills arising from sale of light commercial vehicles and two / three wheelers.

8.13 UCBs may exercise their commercial judgment in discounting of bills of services sector. However, while discounting such bills, UCBs should ensure that actual services are rendered, and accommodation bills are not discounted. Services sector bills should not be eligible for rediscounting. Further, providing finance against discounting of services sector bills may be treated as unsecured advance and therefore, should be within the limits prescribed by Reserve Bank of India for sanction of unsecured advances.

8.14 In order to promote payment discipline which would to a certain extent encourage acceptance of bills, all corporate and other constituent borrowers having turnover above threshold level as fixed by the bank's Board of Directors should be mandated to disclose 'aging schedule' of their overdue payables in their periodical returns submitted to banks.

8.15 Any violation of these instructions will be viewed seriously and invite penal action from Reserve Bank of India.

#### <span id="page-17-0"></span>**9. Loans to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)**

UCBs may lend to SHGs and JLGs as per their Board approved policy framed in this regard, according to the guidelines prescribed below:

#### 9.1 Lending Policy

Lending to SHGs / JLGs would be considered as normal business activity of the UCB. UCBs will be required to frame, with the approval of their Board, a comprehensive policy on lending to SHGs / JLGs. This policy, including the maximum amount of loan, interest rate chargeable on loans etc. should form part of overall credit policy of the UCB.

#### 9.2 Method of Lending

UCBs may follow the method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending through intermediaries will not be permitted.

#### 9.3 Enrolment of SHG / JLG as Member

9.3.1 SHGs are small groups, formal / informal, of individuals promoting savings habit among members. These savings are then lent by the group to the members for income generating purposes. On the other hand, JLG is an informal group of individuals coming together for the

purpose of availing of bank loan either singly or through the group mechanism against mutual guarantee in order to engage in similar type of economic activities.

9.3.2 The SHG would normally consist of 10 to 20 members whereas a JLG would normally have between 4 and 10 members. Membership matters are governed by the byelaws adopted by the UCB and provisions of respective State Co-operative Societies Acts or the Multi State Cooperative Societies Act, 2002. UCBs would, therefore, be required to be guided by the provisions contained in the respective Act and take prior approval of the RCS / CRCS, wherever required, while enrolling such members and granting loans to SHGs / JLGs. The byelaws of UCBs also need to provide for such lending.

9.4 Share Linking Norms

The extant instructions on share linking to borrowing would apply for lending to SHGs / JLGs.

#### 9.5 Nature of Loan - Secured or Unsecured

The extant limits (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.

#### 9.6 Nature of Exposure

Individual or Group: Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on individual exposure limits.

#### 9.7 Amount of Loan

The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit may be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the UCB and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the bank's assessment of the credit requirement.

#### 9.8 Margin and Security for the Loan

Margin / security requirement will be as per Board approved poli
