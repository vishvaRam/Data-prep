# **Guarantees, Co-acceptances & Letters of Credit - UCBs**

# **1. Guarantees**

# 1.1 **Issue of Guarantees**

# 1.1.1 **Broad Guidelines**

In view of the risks involved in the business of issuance of guarantees, the Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) should extend guarantees within restricted limits so that their financial position is not impaired. The banks should follow certain broad guidelines in respect of their guarantee business as indicated in the following paragraphs.

# 1.1.2 **Purpose**

(i) As a general rule, banks may provide only financial guarantees and not performance guarantees.

(ii) However, scheduled banks may issue performance guarantees on behalf of their constituents subject to exercising due caution in the matter.

# 1.1.3 **Maturity**

It would be desirable for UCBs to confine their guarantees to relatively short-term maturities. Guarantees should not be issued for periods exceeding ten years in any case.

# 1.1.4 **Volume**

The total volume of guarantee obligations outstanding at any time may not exceed 10 per cent of the total owned resources of the bank comprising paid up capital, reserves and deposits. Within the overall ceiling, proportion of unsecured guarantees outstanding at any time may be limited to an amount equivalent to 25% of the owned funds (paid up capital + reserves) of the bank or 25% of the total amount of guarantees, whichever is less.

### 1.1.5 **Secured Guarantees**

Banks should preferably issue secured guarantees. A secured guarantee means a guarantee made on the security of assets (including cash margin), the market value of which will not at any time be less than the amount of the contingent liability on the guarantee, or a guarantee fully covered by counter guarantee/s of the Central Government, State Governments, public sector financial institutions and / or insurance companies.

# 1.1.6 **Unsecured Guarantees**

Banks should avoid undue concentration of unsecured guarantee commitments to particular groups of customers and / or trades. The banks' Board of Directors should fix suitable proportions for issuance of unsecured guarantees on behalf of any individual constituent so that these guarantees do not exceed a -

(a) reasonable proportion of the total obligations in respect of unsecured guarantees provided by the bank to all such constituents at any time, and

(b) reasonable multiple of the shareholdings in the bank.

### 1.1.7 **Deferred Payment Guarantees**

(i) Banks should generally provide deferred payment guarantees backed by adequate tangible securities or by counter guarantees of the Central or the State Government or public sector financial institutions or of insurance companies and other banks.

(ii) Banks, which intend to issue deferred payment guarantees on behalf of their borrowers for acquisition of capital assets should ensure that the total credit facilities including the proposed deferred payment guarantees do not exceed the prescribed exposure ceilings.

(iii) The proposals for deferred payment guarantees should be examined having regard to the profitability / cash flows of the project to ensure that sufficient surpluses are generated by the borrowing unit to meet the commitments as a bank has to meet the liability at regular intervals in respect of the instalments due. The criteria generally followed for appraising a term loan proposal for acquisition of capital assets should also be applied while issuing deferred payment guarantees.

#### 1.2 **Guarantees in respect of Commodities covered under Selective Credit Controls**

UCBs should not issue, either to a Court or to Government, or any other person, a guarantee on behalf of or on account of any importers guaranteeing payment of customs duty and / or import duty, or other levies, payable in respect
