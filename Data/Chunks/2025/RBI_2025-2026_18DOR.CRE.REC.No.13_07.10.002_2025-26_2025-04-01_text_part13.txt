## <span id="page-23-0"></span>**Safeguards to be observed Advances against Pledge of Gold / Silver Ornaments**

(vide paragraph 7.5.1)

## **i) Ownership of Ornaments**

It is advisable that the advances are made to persons properly introduced to the UCB. The UCB should satisfy itself about the ownership of the gold ornaments etc. before accepting them for pledge. The UCB should obtain a declaration from the borrower that the ornaments are his own property and that he has the fullest right to pledge them to the UCB. Taking of ornaments for pledge and release thereof to the parties concerned after repayment of the bank's dues should be done strictly in the authorised official's room to avoid any risk.

## **ii) Appraiser**

The UCB should appoint an approved jeweller or shroff as an appraiser for valuation of the gold ornaments proposed to be pledged to the UCB and obtain adequate security from him in the form of cash and indemnity bond. Valuation and appraisal of the ornaments in the bank's premises itself would be ideal but when these are not possible, the UCB should take suitable precautions against their loss while in transit. The UCB should send the ornaments to the appraiser in a locked box, one key of which should be kept with the appraiser and the other with the UCB. The box should be sent through a responsible member of the staff along with the prospective borrower. The placing of ornaments in the box at both the ends should be done in the presence of the employee carrying the ornaments to the appraiser and the borrower. The UCB should take a suitable insurance cover for loss of the ornaments while in transit.

## **iii) Valuation Report**

- a. The valuation certificate of the appraiser should clearly indicate the description of the ornaments, their fitness, gross weight of the ornaments, net weight of the gold content exclusive of stones, lac, alloy, strings, fastenings and the value of the gold at the prevailing market price. The valuation report should be duly signed by the appraiser and kept along with the loan documents by the UCB.
- b. In order to standardize the valuation and make it more transparent to the borrower, it has been decided that gold jewellery accepted as security/collateral will have to be valued at the average of the closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the India Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd. [Formerly known as the Bombay Bullion Association Ltd. (BBA)]. In terms of [circular DCBR.BPD. \(PCB/RCB\). Cir. No.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10075&Mode=0)  [3/13.05.001/2015-16 dated October 15, 2015,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10075&Mode=0) UCBs may also use the historical spot gold price data of the preceding 30 days publicly disseminated by a Commodity Exchange regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. If the gold is of purity less than 22 carats, the UCB should translate the collateral into 22 carat and value the exact grams of the collateral. In other words, jewellery of lower purity of gold shall be valued proportionately

## **iv) Record of Security**

The full name of the borrower, his residential address, date of advance, amount and description of the ornaments in detail should be recorded in the gold ornaments register which should be checked / initialled by the Manager.

## **v) Custody of Ornaments**

The ornaments belonging to each borrower (or articles of each loan) together with a list indicating the description of ornaments, gold loan account number, name of party, etc. should be kept separately in small cloth bags. A tag indicating loan account number and name of the party should be tied to the bag to facilitate identification. The bags should be arranged in trays according to loan account numbers and kept in the strong room or fire proof safes under joint custody.

## **vi) Period**

The period of advance against gold ornaments should be generally restricted to 6 months or 1 year.

### **vii) Margin**

- a) As a prudential measure, Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio of not exceeding 75% is applicable for UCBs' lending against gold jewellery (including bullet repayment loans against pledge of gold jewellery). The UCB should collect interest on advances promptly. In no circumstances should it allow to water down the margin by debiting the interest accrued to the loan account.
- b) Hallmarking of gold jewellery ensures t
