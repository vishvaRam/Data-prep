### **2.2 Guidelines relating to conduct of guarantee business**

#### **2.2.1 Norms for unsecured advances & guarantees**

- 2.2.1.1 Until June 17, 2004, banks were required to limit their commitments by way of unsecured guarantees in such a manner that 20 percent of a bank's outstanding unsecured guarantees plus the total of its outstanding unsecured advances should not exceed 15 percent of its total outstanding advances. In order to provide further flexibility to banks on their loan policies, the above limit on unsecured exposure of banks was withdrawn and banks' Boards have been given the freedom to fix their own policies on their unsecured exposures. "Unsecured exposure" is defined as an exposure where the realisable value of the security, as assessed by the bank/ approved valuers / Reserve Bank's inspecting officers, is not more than 10 per cent, ab-initio, of the outstanding exposure. Exposure shall include all funded and nonfunded exposures (including underwriting and similar commitments). 'Security' will mean tangible security properly charged to the bank and will not include intangible securities like guarantees (including State government guarantees), letter of comfort, etc.
- 2.2.1.2 For determining the amount of unsecured advances for reflecting in schedule 9 of the published balance sheet, the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the banks as collateral in respect of projects (including infrastructure projects) financed by them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Banks, may however, treat annuities under build-operate â€“transfer (BOT) model in respect of road/highway projects and toll collection rights where there are provisions to compensate the project sponsor if a certain level of traffic is not achieved, as tangible securities, subject to the condition that banks' right to receive annuities and toll collection rights is legally enforceable and irrevocable.
- 2.2.1.3 All exemptions allowed for computation of unsecured advances stand withdrawn.

## **2.2.2 Precautions for issuing guarantees**

Banks should adopt the following precautions while issuing guarantees on behalf of their customers.

(i) As a rule, banks should avoid giving unsecured guarantees in large amounts and for medium and long-term periods. They should avoid undue concentration of such unsecured guarantee commitments to particular groups of customers and/or trades.

(ii) Unsecured guarantees on account of any individual constituent should be limited to a reasonable proportion of the bank's total unsecured guarantees. Guarantees on behalf of an individual should also bear a reasonable proportion to the constituent's equity.

(iii) In exceptional cases, banks may give deferred payment guarantees on an unsecured basis for modest amounts to first class customers who have entered into deferred payment arrangements in consonance with Government policy.

(iv) Guarantees executed on behalf of any individual constituent, or a group of constituents, should be subject to the prescribed exposure norms.

(v) It is essential to realise that guarantees contain inherent risks and that it would not be in the bank's interest or in the public interest,
