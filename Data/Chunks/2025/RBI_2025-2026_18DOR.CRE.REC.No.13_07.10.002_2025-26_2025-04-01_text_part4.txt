 the audited financial statements from the borrowers enjoying large limits; since such borrowers would, in any case, be submitting audit certificate to the income-tax authorities, based on audit of their books of accounts by a Chartered Accountant.

#### 4.5 Defaults in Payment of Statutory Dues by Borrowers

UCBs may ensure that borrowers enjoying credit facilities, pay the provident fund payments and similar other statutory dues promptly. The non-payment of statutory dues by the borrowers is one of the symptoms of incipient sickness of an industrial unit. Therefore, it is in the interest of both the lender and borrower to give high priority to the clearance of these dues. Apart from insisting on the borrowers to indicate a definite programme for clearance of arrears, UCBs may consider suitable restrictions on the outflow of funds. UCBs may incorporate an appropriate declaration in their application forms for grant / renewal / enhancement of credit facilities so as to ensure that the position regarding the statutory dues is disclosed therein. In respect of the corporate borrowers and non-corporate borrowers, the amount of statutory dues should normally be reflected in their audited annual accounts. In case audited accounts do not indicate the position clearly, a certificate may be obtained from the Chartered Accountant for this purpose.

#### 4.6 Sanction of Advances

#### 4.6.1 Irregularities / Deficiencies in Credit Sanction

UCBs should take suitable precautions to avoid irregular practices such as sanctioning advances beyond discretionary powers and / or without proper credit appraisal in order to minimise chances of frauds.

#### 4.6.2 Delegation of Powers

- (i) The Board of Directors should delegate specific powers to the Branch Managers and other functionaries at the Head Office level as also to the Chairman in the matter of sanction of advances and expenditure. A system should also be introduced to ensure that powers are exercised within the limits prescribed and any transgressions are immediately reported to Head Office.
- (ii) The internal inspectors should examine during the course of inspection of branches whether powers have been exercised properly and any unauthorised exercise of powers should immediately be brought to the notice of Head Office. Similarly, sanctions beyond discretionary powers by the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and other executives at the Head Office should also be reported to the Board of Directors.

#### 4.6.3 Oral Sanction

The higher authorities at various levels should desist from the unhealthy practice of conveying sanction of advances orally or on telephone.

#### 4.6.4 Proper Record of Deviations

4.6.4.1 Only in exigencies, where sanctions are made on telephone / oral instructions of higher functionaries or sanctions beyond discretionary powers have to be resorted to, the following steps should be taken:

- (i) Record of such instructions / sanctions should be maintained by the sanctioning / disbursing authorities explaining the circumstances under which sanctions were made.
- (ii) Written confirmation of the competent sanctioning authority should be obtained by the disbursing authority / official within a week / fortnight.
- (iii) Sanctions within discretionary powers should also be reported to Head Office within a stipulated time and Head Office should meticulously follow up receipt of such returns.
- (iv) Head Office should diligently scrutinise the statements / returns and should initiate stringent action against erring functionary(s) if he is / they are / found to have indulged in unauthorised sanctioning.

4.6.4.2 Officials should exercise powers delegated to them judiciously and should not exceed their discretionary powers for granting loans and advances. Violations, if any, in this regard should be viewed seriously and the guilty should be punished suitably.

#### 4.7 Monitoring Operations in Loan Accounts

#### 4.7.1 Post-Sanction Monitoring

4.7.1.1 It is the primary responsibility of UCBs to be vigilant and ensure proper end use of bank funds / monitor the funds flow. It is, therefore, necessary for UCBs to evolve such arrangements as may be considered necessary to ensure that drawals from cash credit / overdraft accounts are strictly for the purpose for which the credit limits are sanctioned by them.

4.7.1.2 Post sanction follow-up of loans and advances should be effective so as to ensure that the security obtained from borrowers by way of hypothecation, pledge, etc. are not tampered with in any manner and are adequate.

#### 4.7.1.3 Accounts showing sign of turning into NPAs

UCBs may put in place more stringent safeguards, especially where accounts show sign of turning into NPAs. In such cases UCBs may strengthen their monitoring system by resorting to more frequent inspections of borrowers' godowns, ensuring that sale proceeds are routed through the borrower's accounts maintained with the UCB and insisting on pledge of the stock in place of hyp
