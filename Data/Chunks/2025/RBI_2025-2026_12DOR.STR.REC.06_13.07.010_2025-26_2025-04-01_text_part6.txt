al discipline, banks, may in their discretion, at the time of renewal obtain guarantees from directors (excluding the nominee directors) and other managerial personnel in their individual capacities if the exposure exhibits signs of stress as per the assessment of the bank. In case, for any reasons, a guarantee is not considered expedient by the bank at the time of sanctioning the advance, an undertaking should be obtained from the individual directors and a covenant should invariably be incorporated in the loan agreement that in case the borrowing unit shows cash losses or adverse current ratio or diversion of fund, the directors would be under an obligation to execute guarantees in their individual capacities, if required by the bank. Banks may also obtain guarantees at their discretion from the parent/holding company when credit facilities are extended to borrowing units in the same Group.

#### **2.2.10 Guarantees of State Government**

The guidelines laid down in paragraph 2.2.9 above, for taking personal guarantees of directors and other managerial personnel, should also be followed in respect of proposal of State Government undertakings/projects and guarantees may not be insisted upon unless absolutely warranted. In other words, banks could obtain guarantees of State Governments on merits and only in circumstances absolutely necessary after thorough examination of the circumstances of each case, and not as matter of course.

## **2.3 Other stipulations – Issuing bid bonds and performance guarantees for export**

With a view to boost exports, banks should adopt a flexible approach in the matter of obtaining cover and earmarking of assets/ credit limits, drawing power, while issuing bid bonds and performance guarantees for export purposes. Banks may, however, safeguard their interests by obtaining coverage from Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (ECGC), wherever considered necessary. Banks may consider sanctioning separate limits for issue of bid bonds. Within the limits so sanctioned, bid bonds against individual contracts may be issued, subject to usual considerations.

#### **2.3.1 Unconditional Guarantees in favour of Overseas Employers/Importers on behalf of Indian Exporters**

- 2.3.1.1 While agreeing to give unconditional guarantee in favour of overseas employers/importers on behalf of Indian Exporters, banks should obtain an undertaking from the exporter to the effect that when the guarantee is invoked, the bank would be entitled to make payment, notwithstanding any dispute between the exporter and the importer. Although, such an undertaking may not prevent the exporter from approaching the Court for an injunction order, it might weigh with the Court in taking a view whether injunction order should be issued.
	- 2.3.1.2 Banks should, while issuing guarantees, keep the above points in view and incorporate suitable clauses in the agreement, in consultation with their legal advisers. This is considered desirable as non-honouring of guarantees on invocation might prompt overseas banks not to accept guarantees of Indian banks, thus hampering the country's export promotion effort.

### **2.3.2 Certain precautions in case of Project Exports**

- 2.3.2.1 As per the provisions of the revised Memorandum of Instructions on Project & Service Exports issued vide [circular on Export of Goods and Services –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9125&Mode=0) Project Exports dated [July 22, 2014,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9125&Mode=0) AD banks/Exim Bank have been authorized to consider according postaward approvals for high value overseas project exports. However, the responsibility of project appraisal and that of monitoring the project lies solely on the lending banks.
- 2.3.2.2 Banks should examine the project proposals thoroughly with regard to the capacity of the contractor/ sub-contractors, protective clauses in the contracts, adequacy of security, credit ratings of the overseas sub-contractors, if any, etc.
- 2.3.2.3 Therefore, the need for a careful assessment of financial and technical demands involved in the proposals vis-à-vis the capability of the contractors (including subcontractors) as well as the overseas employers can hardly be under-rated to the financing of any domestic projects. In fact, the export projects should be given more attention, in view of their high values and the possibilities of foreign exchange losses in case of failure, apart from damage to the image of Indian entrepreneurs.
- 2.3.2.4 While bid bonds and performance guarantees cannot be avoided, it is to be considered whether guarantees should be given by the banks in all cases of overseas borrowings for financing overseas projects. Such guarantees should not be executed as a matter of course, merely because of the participation of Exim Bank and availability of counter-guarantee of ECGC. Appropriate arrangements should
