Also, clarity is required on what is meant by the segregation of such NPI investments from the rest of the portfolio?** 

*[Refer Clauses 36(a)(v) & 36(b)of Directions]*

Ans:

- a. In partial modification to the clause 36(a)(v), it is clarified that the equity shares, debentures, bonds, etc., received upon conversion of principal and/or interest, shall be classified under HTM, AFS, or FVTPL (including HFT) only at initial recognition (i.e., when the loan is derecognised and the bond/equity, etc. is recognised), as per Chapter III of the Directions. Banks may, however, note that the asset classification of such instruments shall be the same as the loan and provisions made accordingly as stated in clause 36(a)(v).
- b. The clause 36(b) of the Directions prescribes that once an investment become NPI, it should be segregated from rest of the portfolio and not considered for netting valuation gains and losses. It is clarified that the 'segregation from the rest of the portfolio' in this context means that such investments shall be segregated from other investments within the same category [i.e., HTM, AFS, or FVTPL (including HFT)] under which it was classified at initial recognition. Reclassification of the securities shall be guided by provisions of Chapter VI of the Master Direction.
