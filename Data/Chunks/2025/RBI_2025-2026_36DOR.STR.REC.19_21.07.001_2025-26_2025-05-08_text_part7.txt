## <span id="page-15-1"></span>21.**Structure of DLG arrangements**

- i. DLG arrangements shall be backed by an explicit and legally enforceable contract between the RE and the DLG provider. Such contract, among other things, shall contain the following details:
	- a. Extent of DLG cover;
	- b. Form in which DLG cover is to be maintained with the RE;
- c. Timeline for DLG invocation;
- d. Disclosure requirements as under para 27 of these Directions.

- i. RE shall ensure that the total amount of DLG cover on any outstanding portfolio which is specified upfront shall not exceed five per cent of the total amount disbursed out of that loan portfolio at any given time. In case of implicit guarantee arrangements, the DLG Provider shall not bear performance risk of more than the equivalent amount of five per cent of the underlying loan portfolio.
- ii. The portfolio over which DLG can be offered shall consist of identifiable and measurable loan assets which have been sanctioned (the 'DLG set').

# <span id="page-16-2"></span>24.**Recognition of NPA**

- ii. The amount of DLG invoked shall not be set off against the underlying individual loans, i.e. the liability of the borrowers in respect of the underlying loan shall remain unaffected.
- iii. Recovery by the RE, if any, from the loans on which DLG has been invoked and realised, can be shared with the DLG provider in terms of the contractual arrangement.
- iv. DLG amount once invoked by the RE shall not be reinstated, including through loan recovery.

#### <span id="page-17-0"></span>25.**Treatment of DLG for regulatory capital**

- i. Capital computation, i.e., computation of exposure and application of Credit Risk Mitigation benefits on individual loan assets in the portfolio shall continue to be governed by the extant norms[11](#page-17-3).
- ii. In case, DLG provider is an RE, it shall deduct full amount of the DLG which is outstanding from its capital.

#### <span id="page-17-1"></span>26.**Invocation and tenor of DLG**

- i. RE shall invoke DLG within a maximum overdue period of 120 days, unless the loan dues are made good by the borrower before that.
- ii. The period for which the DLG agreement remains in force shall not be less than the longest tenor of the loan in the underlying loan portfolio.

#### <span id="page-17-2"></span>27.**Disclosure requirements**

i. RE shall put in place a mechanism to ensure that LSPs with whom they have a DLG arrangement shall publish on their website the total number of portfolios and the respective amount of each portfolio on which DLG has been offered.
