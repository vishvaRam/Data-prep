d and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras.1.3 and 1.4 below.

1.2 A loan for an infrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial operations within two years from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 1.3 and 1.4 below.

1.3 There may be occasions when completion of projects is delayed for legal and other extraneous reasons like delays in Government approvals etc. All these factors, which are beyond the control of the promoters, may lead to delay in project implementation and involve restructuring / rescheduling of loans by banks. If a project loan classified as 'standard asset' is restructured any time during the period up to two years from the original date of commencement of commercial operations (DCCO), in accordance with prudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 2.2.7 above, it can be retained as a standard asset if the fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits, and further provided the account continues to be serviced as per the restructured terms:

### **a) Infrastructure Projects involving Court Cases**

Up to another 2 years (beyond the existing extended period of 2 years i.e total extension of 4 years), in case the reason for extension of date of commencement of production is arbitration proceedings or a court case.

## **b) Infrastructure Projects delayed for other reasons beyond the Control of Promoters**

Up to another 1 year (beyond the existing extended period of 2 years i.e. total extension of 3 years), in other than court cases.

1.4 The dispensation in para 1.3 is subject to the condition that the application for restructuring should be received before the expiry of period of two years from the original DCCO and when the account is still standard as per record of recovery. The other conditions applicable would be:

<span id="page-35-1"></span> <sup>9</sup> For greenfield projects, financial closure is defined as a legally binding commitment of equity holders and debt financiers to provide or mobilise funding for the project. Such funding must account for a significant part of the project cost which should not be less than 90 per cent of the total project cost securing the construction of the facility.

i. In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond two years from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts.

ii. Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets as under:


For the purpose of these guidelines, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same.

## **2. Project Loans for Non-Infrastructure Sector**

2.1 A loan for a non-infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue), unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 below.

2.2 A loan for a non-infrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial operations within six months from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 below.

2.3 In case of non-infrastructure projects, if the delay in commencement of commercial operations extends beyond the period of six months from the date of completion as determined at the time of financial closure, banks can prescribe a fresh DCCO, and retain the "standard" classification by undertaking restructuring of accounts in accordance withprudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 2.2.7 above, provided the fresh DCCO does not extend beyond a period of twelve months from the original DCCO. This would among others also imply that the restructuring application is received before the expiry of six months from the original DCCO, and when the account is still "standard" as per the record of recovery.

The other conditions applicable would be:

a) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond six months from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts.

b) Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets as under:


2.4 For this purpose, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same.

3. These guidelines will however not be applicable to restructuring of commercial real estate and housing loans.

4.1 All other aspects of restructuring of pr
