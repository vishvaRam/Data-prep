bonds, etc. as also short-term loans, the repayment of which is proposed / expected to be made out of funds to be or likely to be mobilised from external / other sources and not out of the surplus generated by the use of the asset(s).

7.2 Advances to Real Estate and Commercial Real Estate Sector

UCBs should frame comprehensive prudential norms relating to the ceiling on the total amount of real estate loans, single / aggregate exposure limit for such loans, margins, security, repayment schedule and availability of supplementary finance taking into account guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of India and the policy should be approved by the UCBs' Board. Exposure to builders and contractors for commercial real estate will include fund based and non-fund based exposures secured by mortgages on commercial real estates (office buildings, retail space, multipurpose commercial premises, multi-family residential buildings, multi-tenanted commercial premises, industrial or warehouse space, hotels etc). Further, while framing the policy, the UCBs may also consider for inclusion the National Building Code framed by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). For detailed information the website of Bureau of Indian Standards [\(www.bis.gov.in\)](https://www.bis.gov.in/) can be accessed.

7.3 Financing of Leasing / Hire Purchase Companies

7.4 Working Capital Finance to Information Technology and Software Industry

7.4.1 In order to bring about uniformity in approach, Reserve Bank of India has formulated guidelines for information of UCBs, on various aspects of lending to information technology and software industry to facilitate free flow of credit. The same were enclosed to our circular UBD.No.DS.SUB.No.4/13.05.00/98-99 dated 5 October 1998, addressed to scheduled UCBs. UCBs are, however, free to modify the guidelines based on their own experience without reference to Reserve Bank of India to achieve the purpose of the guidelines in letter and spirit.

7.4.2 These guidelines have been framed based on the recommendations made by the study group appointed by Reserve Bank of India to study the modalities of credit extension to software industry as also taking into account the suggestions made by the industry associations.

7.4.3 UCBs may take adequate steps to develop expertise in this area by training staff in project appraisal in the area of activity. It has to be ensured that the staff concerned is well aware of the requirements of the industry and remain in tune with the latest developments so that the higher standards of project appraisal can be maintained before extending the working capital finance to Information Technology and software industries.
