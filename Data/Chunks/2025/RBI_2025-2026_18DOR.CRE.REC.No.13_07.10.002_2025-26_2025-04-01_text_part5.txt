othecation.

4.7.1.4 Drawals against clearing cheques should be sanctioned only in respect of first class customers and even in such cases the extent of limits and the need therefore should be subjected to thorough scrutiny and periodic review. UCBs should not issue banker's cheques / pay orders / demand drafts against instruments presented for clearing, (unless the proceeds thereof are collected and credited to the account of the party) or to borrowers whose accounts are already overdrawn or likely to be overdrawn with the issue of such instruments.

4.7.1.5 Drawals against clearing instruments should be normally confined to bank drafts and Government cheques and only to a limited extent against third party cheques.

4.7.1.6 Cheques against which drawals are allowed, should represent genuine trade transactions and strict vigilance should be observed against assisting kite-flying operations.

## 4.7.2 Responsibility

4.7.2.1 The primary responsibility for preventing misuse of funds rests with the management of UCBs. UCBs should, therefore, take appropriate steps to review and tighten their internal administration and control measures so as to eliminate the scope for misuse / diversion of funds and malpractices.

4.7.2.2 UCBs should take serious view of instances of misuse of power, corruption and other malpractices indulged by the members of staff and erring staff members should be given punishments befitting the seriousness of the irregularity. Quick disposal of enquiries by the banks and award of deterrent punishment would be necessary in all such cases.

#### 4.8 Annual Review of Advances

For an effective monitoring of the advances, it is imperative for the UCBs to undertake an exercise for review of the advances on a regular basis. Apart from the usual objective of such a review of assessing the quality of operation, safety of funds, etc. the review should specifically attempt to make an assessment of the working capital requirements of the borrower based on the latest data available, whether limits continue to be within the need-based requirements and according to the UCB's prescribed lending norms.

#### 4.9 Valuation of properties-empanelment of valuers

The issue of correct and realistic valuation of fixed assets owned by UCBs and that accepted by them as collateral for a sizable portion of their advances portfolio assumes significance in view of its implications for correct measurement of capital adequacy position of UCBs. UCBs are, therefore, advised to put in place a system / procedure for realistic valuation of fixed assets and also for empanelment of valuers for the purpose as per guidelines given at [Annex-2.](#page-22-0)

## 4.10 Diversion of Funds

UCBs should have a mechanism for proper monitoring of the end use of funds. Wherever diversion is observed, they should take appropriate action including recalling the loans, reduction of sanctioned limits, imposing penal charges etc. to protect the UCB's interest. UCBs should keep a proper vigil over requests of their clients for cash withdrawals from their accounts for large amounts. Whenever stocks under hypothecation to cash credit and other loan accounts are found to have been sold but the proceeds thereof not credited to the loan account, such action should normally be treated as a fraud. In such cases, UCBs may take immediate steps to secure the remaining stock so as to prevent further erosion in the value of the available security as also other action as warranted.

4.11 Diversion of funds would be construed to include any one of the under-noted occurrences:

- (i) Utilisation of short-term working capital funds for long-term purposes not in conformity with the terms of sanctions;
- (ii) deploying borrowed funds for purposes / activities or creation of assets other than those for which the loan was sanctioned;
- (iii) transferring funds to the subsidiaries / group companies or other corporates by whatever modalities;
- (iv) routing of funds through any bank other than the lender bank or members of consortium without prior permission of the lender;
- (v) investment in other companies by way of acquiring equities / debt instruments without approval of lenders;
- (vi) shortfall in deployment of funds *vis-Ã -vis* the amounts disbursed / drawn, and the difference not being accounted for.

4.12 Siphoning of funds should be construed to have occurred if any funds borrowed are utilised for purposes unrelated to the operations of the borrower, to the detriment of the financial health of the entity or of the lender. The decision as to whether a particular instance amounts to siphoning of funds would have to be a judgement of the lenders based on objective facts and circumstances of the case.

## 4.13 End-use of Funds

In cases of project financing, UCBs should seek to ensure end use of funds by, inter alia, obtaining certification from the Chartered Accountants for the purpose. In case of short-term corporate / clean loans, such an approach ought t
