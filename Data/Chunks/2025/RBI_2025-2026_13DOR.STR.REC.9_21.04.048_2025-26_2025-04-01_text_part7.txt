#### 4.2.15 Projects under implementation

## *4.2.15.1 'Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations' (DCCO)*

For all projects financed by the FIs/ banks, the DCCO of the project should be clearly spelt out at the time of financial closure of the project and the same should be formally documented. These should also be documented in the appraisal note by the bank during sanction of the loan.

#### *4.2.15.2 Deferment of DCCO*

(i) There are occasions when the completion of projects is delayed for legal and other extraneous reasons like delays in Government approvals etc. All these factors, which are beyond the control of the promoters, may lead to delay in project implementation and involve restructuring / reschedulement of loans by banks. Accordingly, the following asset classification norms would apply to the project loans before commencement of commercial operations.

(ii) For this purpose, all project loans have been divided into the following two categories:

- a) Project Loans for infrastructure sector
- b) Project Loans for non-infrastructure sector

*'Project Loan' would mean any term loan which has been extended for the purpose of setting up of an economic venture. Further, Infrastructure Sector is a sector included in the Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure sub-sectors issued by the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, from time to time.*

(iii) Deferment of DCCO and consequential shift in repayment schedule for equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) will not be treated as restructuring provided that:

a) The revised DCCO falls within the period of two years and one year from the original DCCO stipulated at the time of financial closure for infrastructure projects and non-infrastructure projects (including commercial real estate projects) respectively; and

b) All other terms and conditions of the loan remain unchanged.

As such project loans will be treated as standard assets in all respects, they will attract standard asset provision of 0.40 per cent.

(iv) Banks may restructure project loans, by way of revision of DCCO beyond the time limits quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above and retain the 'standard' asset classification, if the fresh DCCO is fixed within the following limits, and the account continues to be serviced as per the restructured terms:

## *a) Infrastructure Projects involving court cases*

Up to another two years (beyond the two-year period quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above, i.e., total extension of four years), in case the reason for extension of DCCO is arbitration proceedings or a court case.

*b) Infrastructure Projects delayed for other reasons beyond the control of promoters*

Up to another one year (beyond the two-year period quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above, i.e., total extension of three years), in case the reason for extension of DCCO is beyond the control of promoters (other than court cases).

*c) Project Loans for Non-Infrastructure Sector (Other than Commercial Real Estate Exposures)*

Up to another one year (beyond the one-year period quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above, i.e., total extension of two years).

*d) Project Loans for Commercial Real Estate Exposures delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoter(s)*

Up to another one-year (beyond the one-year period quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above, i.e., total extension of two years), provided that the revised repayment schedule is extended only by a period equal to or shorter than the extension in DCCO and all provisions of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 are complied with.

(v) It is re-iterated that a loan for a project may be classified as NPA during any time before commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue). It is further re-iterated that the dispensation at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iv) is subject to the condition that the application for restructuring should be received before the expiry of period mentioned at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iii) (a) above and when the account is still standard as per record of recovery. The other conditions applicable would be:

a) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond two years and one year from the original DCCO for infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects (including commercial real estate projects) respectively, considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts.

b) Banks should maintain following provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets:



(vi) In case of infrastructure projects, where Ap
