, IFRS 10 for deconsolidation. When disclosing the leverage ratio, banks must also disclose the extent of such de-recognised fiduciary items as set out in paragraph 16.7.4.

16.4.3.2 Banks must calculate their derivative exposures[136](#page-170-0), including where a bank sells protection using a credit derivative, as the replacement cost (RC)[137](#page-170-1) for the current exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure (PFE), as described in paragraph 16.4.3.3 below. If the derivative exposure is covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as specified in the **[Annex](#page-304-0)  [18](#page-304-0)** (part B), an alternative treatment as indicated in paragraph 16.4.3.4 below may be applied[138.](#page-170-2) Written credit derivatives are subject to an additional treatment, as set out in paragraphs 16.4.3.11 to 16.4.3.14 below.

16.4.3.3 For a single derivative contract, not covered by an eligible bilateral netting contract as specified in **[Annex 18](#page-304-0)** (part B), the amount to be included in the exposure measure is determined as follows:

exposure measure = replacement cost (RC) + add-on

where;

RC = the replacement cost of the contract (obtained by marking to market), where the contract has a positive value.

add-on = an amount for PFE over the remaining life of the contract calculated by applying an add-on factor to the notional principal amount of the derivative. The add-on factors are given in Table 9 of paragraph 5.15.3.4 and Tables 20 & 21 of paragraph 8.6.3.

16.4.3.4 *Bilateral netting*: when an eligible bilateral netting contract is in place as specified in **[Annex 18](#page-304-0)** (part B), the RC for the set of derivative exposures covered by the contract will be the sum of net replacement cost and the add-on factors as described in paragraph 16.4.3.3 above will be ANet as calculated below:

(a) Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forward transactions will be calculated as the sum of the net mark-to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus an add-on based on the notional underlying principal. The add-on for netted transactions (ANet) will equal the weighted average of the gross

<span id="page-170-0"></span> <sup>136</sup> This approach makes reference to the Current Exposure Method (CEM) to calculate CCR exposure amounts associated with derivative exposures. The Basel Committee will consider whether the recently released Standardised Approach for measuring exposure at default (EAD) for CCR known as SA-CCR is appropriate in the context of the need to capture both types of exposures created by derivatives as described in paragraph 16.4.3.1. Banks operating in India may continue to use CEM until advised otherwise by the Reserve Bank

<span id="page-170-1"></span><sup>137</sup> If, under the relevant accounting standards, there is no accounting measure of exposure for certain derivative instruments because they are held (completely) off-balance sheet, the bank must use the sum of positive fair values of these derivatives as the replacement cost.

<span id="page-170-2"></span><sup>138</sup> These netting rules are with the exception of cross-product netting i.e. cross-product netting is not permitted in determining the leverage ratio exposure measure. However, where a bank has a cross-product netting agreement in place that meets the eligibility criteria of Annex 20 (part B) it may choose to perform netting separately in each product category provided that all other conditions for netting in this product category that are applicable to the Basel III leverage ratio are met.

add-on (AGross) and the gross add-on adjusted by the ratio of net current replacement cost to gross current replacement cost (NGR). This is expressed through the following formula:

ANet = 0.4 · AGross + 0.6 · NGR · AGross

where:

NGR = level of net replacement cost / level of gross replacement cost for transactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements[139](#page-171-0)

AGross = sum of individual add-on amounts (calculated by multiplying the notional principal amount by the appropriate add-on factors set out in Table 9 of paragraph 5.15.3.4 and Tables 20 & 21 of paragraph 8.6.3) of all transactions subject to legally enforceable netting agreements with one counterparty.

(b) For the purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure to a netting counterparty for forward foreign exchange contracts and other similar contracts in which the notional principal amount is equivalent to cash flows, the notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each value date in each currency. The reason for this is that offsetting contracts in the same currency maturing on the same date will have lower potential future exposure as well as lower current exposure.

16.4.3.5 *Treatment of related collateral*: collateral received in connection with derivative contracts has two countervailing effects on leverage:

- it reduces counterparty exposure; but
- it can also increase
