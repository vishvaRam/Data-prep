7.5.3 Crop loans sanctioned against the collateral security of gold ornaments shall continue to be governed by the extant income recognition, asset classification and provisioning norms for such loans.

7.5.4 UCBs are not permitted to grant any advance for purchase of gold in any form, including primary gold, gold bullion, gold jewellery, gold coins, units of gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) and units of gold Mutual Funds.

7.6 Grant of Loans for Acquisition of / Investing in Small Savings Instruments including Kisan Vikas Patras (KVP)

Grant of loans for acquiring / investing in KVPs does not promote fresh savings and, rather, channelise the existing savings in the form of bank deposits to small savings instruments and thereby defeat the very purpose of such schemes. UCBs may therefore ensure that no loans are sanctioned for acquisition of / investing in small savings instruments including KVPs.

7.7 Lending to Public Sector Undertakings

UCBs are advised, as a matter of principle, generally not to grant large value loans to Public Sector / Government Undertakings.

## <span id="page-15-0"></span>**8. Discounting / Rediscounting of Bills by UCBs**

UCBs may adhere to the following guidelines while purchasing / discounting / negotiating / rediscounting of genuine commercial / trade bills:

8.1 Since UCBs have already been given freedom to decide their own guidelines for assessing / sanctioning working capital limits of borrowers, they may sanction working capital limit as also bills limit to borrowers after proper appraisal of their credit needs and in accordance with the loan policy as approved by their Board of Directors.

8.2 UCBs should clearly lay down a bill discounting policy approved by their Board of Directors, which should be consistent with their policy of sanctioning of working capital limits. In this case, the procedure for Board approval should include banks' core operating process from the time the bills are tendered till these are realised. UCBs may review their core operating processes and simplify the procedure in respect of bills financing. In order to address the problem of delay in realisation of bills, UCBs may take advantage of improved computer / communication network like Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), wherever available, and adopt the system of 'value dating' of their clients' accounts.

8.3 UCBs should open letters of credit (LCs) and purchase / discount / negotiate bills under LCs only in respect of genuine commercial and trade transactions of their borrower constituents who have been sanctioned regular credit facilities by the banks. UCBs should not, therefore, extend fund based (including bills financing) or non-fund based facilities like opening of LCs, providing guarantees and acceptances to non-constituent borrower or / and non-constituent member of a consortium / multiple banking arrangement.

8.4 With effect from March 30, 2012, in case of bills drawn under LCs restricted to a particular UCB, and the beneficiary of the LC is not a borrower who has been granted regular credit facility by that UCB, the UCB concerned may, as per their discretion and based on their perception about the credit worthiness of the LC issuing bank, negotiate such LCs, subject to the condition that the proceeds will be remitted to the regular banker of the beneficiary of the LC. However, the prohibition regarding negotiation of unrestricted LCs for borrowers who have not been sanctioned regular credit facilities will continue to be in force.

8.5 UCBs negotiating bills as above, under restricted LCs, would have to adhere to the instructions of the Reserve Bank / RCS or CRCS regarding share linking to borrowing and provisions of Cooperative Societies Act on membership.

8.6 For the purpose of credit exposure, bills purchased / discounted / negotiated under LC (where the payment to the beneficiary is not made 'under reserve') will be treated as an exposure on the LC issuing bank and not on the borrower. All clean negotiations as indicated above will be assigned the risk weight as is normally applicable to inter-bank exposures, for capital adequacy purposes. In the case of negotiations 'under reserve' the exposure should be treated as on the borrower and risk weight assigned accordingly.

8.7 While purchasing / discounting / negotiating bills under LCs or otherwise, UCBs should establish genuineness of underlying transactions / documents.

8.8 UCBs should ensure that blank LC forms are kept in safe custody as in case of security items like blank cheques, demand drafts etc. and verified / balanced on daily basis. LC forms should be issued to customers under joint signatures of the bank's authorised officials.

8.9 The practice of drawing bills of exchange claused 'without recourse' and issuing letters of credit bearing the legend 'without recourse' should be discouraged because such notatio
