6.8.1 Admission of NBFCs as Members

(i) For availing loans or advances from a UCB, its membership is a must. However, UCBs are normally not expected to enroll non-banking financial institutions (like investment and financial companies as well as other persons engaged in the business competing with or conflicting with the business of the bank) as their members since it would be in contravention of the state co-operative societies act concerned and will also not be in conformity with the provision of model by-law No. 9. Therefore, **banks should not finance NBFCs, other than those engaged in hire-purchase / leasing**.

(ii) Similarly, admission of non-banking financial companies which are **not engaged exclusively** in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the state cooperative societies act concerned and model bylaw No. 9. It will, therefore, be necessary for the UCBs to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting such leasing / hire purchase companies as members.

6.8.2 Activities eligible for finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities

Within the prescribed credit exposure norms and above stated restrictions, UCBs, with working capital funds aggregating to â‚¹25 crore and above, may finance the NBFC - Investment and Credit Companies (NBFC-ICC), subject to the following limits:


Note

(i) The maximum limit on bank finance should be within the overall ceiling of borrowing by NBFCs, upto ten times of their NOF.

(ii) Bank finance to leasing concerns should be restricted only to "full payout" leases i.e., those leases where the cost of the asset is fully recovered during the primary lease period itself and further it should cover purchases of only new equipment.

(iii) As a prudent policy, lease rentals due during the period of next five years should alone be taken into account for the purpose of lending.

6.8.3 Activities not Eligible for Finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities

6.8.3.1 The following activities undertaken by non-banking financial companies engaged in hire purchase / leasing activities are not eligible for bank credit. As such, these items should be excluded from the build-up of current assets while arriving at permissible bank finance for all categories of NBFCs :

(i) Bills discounted / rediscounted by NBFCs, except where specifically permitted;

(ii) Investments made in shares, debentures etc. of a current nature, i.e., stockin-trade;

(iii) Investment in and advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other entities; and,

(iv) Investments in and inter-corporate loans / deposits to other companies.

6.8.3.2 In respect of items indicated at (i) and (ii) above, banks should not make any adjustment in the projected net working capital (NWC). It may be added that the projected NWC represents long-term surplus available to support current operations and, therefore, does not need to be adjusted as a result of changing / pruning the level of current assets while reducing the level of maximum permissible bank finance.

# 6.8.4 Financing of NBFCs by Scheduled UCBs

Scheduled UCBs may rediscount bills discounted by NBFCs arising from sale of commercial vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject to normal lending safeguards and the following conditions:

(i) the bills should have been drawn by the manufacturers on dealers only;

(ii) the bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from the chassis / engine numbers; and,

(iii) before rediscounting the bills, the UCBs should satisfy themselves about the bona- fides and track record of NBFCs which have discounted the bills.
