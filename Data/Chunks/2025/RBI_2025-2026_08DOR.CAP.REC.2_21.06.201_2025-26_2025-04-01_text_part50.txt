capital charge measures into a maturity ladder with the fifteen time bands as set out in **Table 15**;
- iv. subject long and short positions (short position is not allowed in India except in derivatives and Central Government Securities) in each time band to a 5 per cent vertical disallowance designed to capture basis risk; and

**Table 16 - Horizontal Disallowances**

8.3.9 The measurement system should include all interest rate derivatives and off balance-sheet instruments in the trading book which react to changes in interest rates, (e.g. forward rate agreements (FRAs), other forward contracts, bond futures, interest rate and cross-currency swaps and forward foreign exchange positions). Options can be treated in a variety of ways as described in **[Annex 9](#page-233-0)**.

### **8.4 Measurement of Capital Charge for Equity Risk**

8.4.1 The capital charge for equities would apply on their fair value in bank's trading book. Minimum capital requirement to cover the risk of holding or taking positions in equities in the trading book is set out below. This is applied to all instruments that exhibit market behaviour similar to equities but not to non-convertible preference shares (which are covered by the interest rate risk requirements described earlier). The instruments covered include equity shares[96](#page-102-0), whether voting or non-voting, convertible securities that behave like equities, for example: units of funds[97](#page-102-1) (other than debt mutual funds/ETFs mentioned in para 8.3.4), and commitments to buy or sell equity.
