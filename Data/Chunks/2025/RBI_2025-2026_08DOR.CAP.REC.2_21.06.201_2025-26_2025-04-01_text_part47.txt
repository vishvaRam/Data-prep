## **7.7 Treatment of pools of CRM Techniques**

In the case where a bank has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure (e.g., a bank has both collateral and guarantee partially covering an exposure), the bank will be required to subdivide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM technique (e.g., portion covered by collateral, portion covered by guarantee) and the risk-weighted assets of each portion must be calculated separately. When credit protection provided by a single protection provider has differing maturities, they must be subdivided into separate protection as well.

### **8.1 Introduction**

Market risk is defined as the risk of losses in on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions arising from movements in market prices. The market risk positions subject to capital charge requirement are:

- (i) The risks pertaining to interest rate related instruments and equities in the trading book; and
- (ii) Foreign exchange risk (including open position in precious metals) throughout the bank (both banking and trading books).

# **8.2 Scope and Coverage of Capital Charge for Market Risks**

8.2.1 These guidelines seek to address the issues involved in computing capital charges for interest rate related instruments in the trading book, equities in the trading book and foreign exchange risk (including gold and other precious metals) in both trading and banking books. Trading book for the purpose of capital adequacy will include all instruments that are classified as "Held for Trading" as per Master Direction - [Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12534)  [Portfolio of Commercial Banks \(Directions\),](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12534) 2023 dated September 12, 2023. All other instruments[93](#page-93-1) will be included in the banking book and attract corresponding capital charge for credit risk (or counterparty credit risk, where applicable).

8.2.2 Banks are required to manage the market risks in their books on an ongoing basis and ensure that the capital requirements for market risks are being maintained on a continuous basis,

<span id="page-93-1"></span> <sup>93</sup> Accordingly, instruments classified under HTM, AFS, FVTPL (non-HFT) and investments in own subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates will also be part of banking book and will not attract market risk capital charge.

i.e., at the close of each business day. Banks are also required to maintain strict risk management systems to monitor and control intra-day exposures to market risks.

8.2.3 Capital for market risk would not be relevant for securities, which have already matured and remain unpaid. These securities will attract capital only for credit risk. On completion of 90 days delinquency, these will be treated on par with NPAs for deciding the appropriate risk weights for credit risk.

8.2.4 The risk-weighted assets for market risk should be determined by multiplying the market risk capital charge by a factor of 12.5, as provided in paragraph 8.7. The market risk capital charge is the simple sum of the capital requirements arising from each of the three risk classes – namely interest rate risk, equity risk and foreign exchange risk as detailed in the formula below:

= ∗ + ∗ + ∗

where:

a) = capital requirement prescribed for interest rate risk under paragraph 8.3 and [Annex 9](#page-233-0) (including additional requirements for options such as non-delta risks);

b) = capital requirement prescribed for equity risk under paragraph 8.4;

c) = capital requirement prescribed for forex risk under paragraph 8.5 and [Annex 9](#page-233-0) (including additional requirements for options such as non-delta risks);

- d) = Scaling factor of 1.2;
- e) = Scaling factor of 2.0; and
- f) = Scaling factor of 1.1.

*Note: The scalars provided above are part of a transition arrangement. Upon implementation of 'final guidelines on minimum capital requirements for Market Risk - Simplified Standardised Approach', the scalars will be*  = 1.3; = 3.5; *and*  = 1.2.

### **8.3 Measurement of Capital Charge for Interest Rate Risk**

8.3.1 This section describes the framework for measuring the risk of holding or taking positions in debt securities and other interest rate related instruments in the trading book.

8.3.2 The capital charge for interest rate related instruments would apply to fair value of these items in bank's trading book. Since banks are required to maintain capital for market risks on an ongoing basis, they are required to mark to market their trading positions on a daily basis. The fair value will be determined as per extant RBI guidelines on valuation of investments.

8.3.3 The minimum capital requirement is expressed in terms of two separately calculated charges, (i) "**specific risk**" charge for each security, which is designed to pro
