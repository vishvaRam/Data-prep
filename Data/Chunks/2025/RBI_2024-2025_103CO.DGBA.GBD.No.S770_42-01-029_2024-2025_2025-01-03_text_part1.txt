All Agency Banks

Madam/Dear Sir,

## **Status of March 30, 2025 for Government transactions through integration with e-Kuber**

The 'e-Kuber' which is the Core Banking Solution platform of RBI for Government and other payments does not process any Government transactions on Global holidays (which are 26th January, 15th August, 2nd October, all 2nd and 4th Saturdays of a month and on all Sundays). It is observed that March 30, 2025 falls on a Sunday. The Office of Controller General of Accounts, Government of India has advised that in order to account for all the Government transactions relating to receipts and payments in the financial year 2024-25 itself, March 30, 2025 (Sunday) be marked as a working day for the Government transactions.

2. Accordingly, it has been decided that e-Kuber will be open for Government transactions on March 30, 2025 so that all the Government transactions through integration with e-Kuber processed on March 30, 2025 are accounted for and the cash balances of Central Government and State Governments are arrived as on March 30, 2025.

3. Also, the luggage files from banks for transferring the data related to Government transactions to RBI would also be accepted by e-Kuber system on March 30, 2025 (Sunday) up to the stipulated cut-off time for accounting of the same on March 30, 2025 itself.

Yours faithfully

(Indranil Chakraborty) Chief General Manager
