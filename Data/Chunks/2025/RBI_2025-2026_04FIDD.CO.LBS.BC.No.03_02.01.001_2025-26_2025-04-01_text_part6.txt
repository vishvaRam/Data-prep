## **2.3.4 SLBC - Yearly Calendar of Meetings**

i) To improve the effectiveness and streamline the functioning of SLBC/UTLBC meetings, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised to prepare a yearly calendar of programmes (calendar year basis) at the beginning of the year itself, for conducting the meetings. The calendar of programmes should clearly specify the cut off dates for data submission to SLBC and acceptance thereof by the SLBC Convenor. This yearly calendar should be circulated to all the concerned as an advance intimation for blocking of future dates of senior functionaries of various agencies like Central Government, State Governments, banks, RBI, etc. The SLBC/UTLBC meetings should be conducted as per the calendar under all circumstances. The agenda should also be circulated in advance without waiting for the data from defaulting banks. The matter should, however, be taken up with the defaulting banks in the SLBC meeting. In addition, the SLBC Convenor Bank should write a letter in this regard to the controlling office of the defaulting banks under advice to the Regional Office of RBI. The SLBC Convenor Bank will, however, continue to follow-up with banks for timely data submission. Further, in case the Chief Minister, Finance Minister or other senior functionaries are not able to attend the SLBC on some rare occasion, then if so desired by them, a special SLBC meeting can be held. Following broad guidelines should be used for preparation of the calendar of programmes:


ii) The objective of preparing the calendar of meetings in the beginning of the year is to ensure adequate notice of these meetings and timely compilation and dispatch of agenda papers to all stakeholders. It also ensures clear cut guidelines for the submission of data to SLBC Convenors by participating banks and Government Departments. It is expected to save precious time of SLBC Convenors that is otherwise spent in taking dates from various senior functionaries attending these SLBC meetings.

iii) SLBC Convenor Banks need to appreciate the advantages of ensuring adherence to the yearly calendars. SLBC Convenor Banks have therefore been advised to give wide publicity to the annual calendar at the beginning of the year and ensure that dates of senior functionaries expected to attend the meetings are blocked for all meetings by their offices. In case, despite blocking dates, if for some reason, the senior functionary is not able to attend the meeting, the meeting should be held as planned in the calendar. More importantly, the data for review in these meetings should be received as per deadlines set in the calendar and those who do not submit the data in time should be asked to explain the reasons for delay in sending the data that may be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. Under no circumstance, should the preparation of the agenda be delayed beyond the dates stipulated as per the calendar.

## **2.3.5 SLBC Website â€“ Standardisation of information /data**

SLBC Convenor Banks are required to maintain the SLBC websites where all instructions pertaining to LBS and Government Sponsored Schemes are made available and are accessible to the common man desiring any information relating to the conduct of meetings or State-wise data/ bank-wise performance. In order to standardize the information and data that is to be made available on the SLBC website, an indicative list is given in the [Annex II.](#page-48-0) SLBCs should arrange to place the prescribed minimum information on the websites of SLBCs of their bank and keep it updated regularly, at least on quarterly basis. Banks may note that the list is only indicative and SLBCs are free to put any additional information considered relevant for the State.

## **2.3.6 Liaison with State Government**

SLBC Convenor Banks are expected to co-ordinate the activities of all banks in the State, discuss with State Government officials, the operational problems in lending, extending necessary support for banking development and to achieve the objective of financial inclusion.

## **2.3.7 Capacity Building/ Training/ Sensitization Programmes**

i) There is a need for sensitising the District Collectors and CEOs of Zilla Parishads on banks and banking in general as also on the specific scope and role of the LBS. In each State, a full day 'Sensitisation Workshop' may be convened by the SLBC Convenor Bank every year, preferably in April/ May. Such sensitisation should form part of the probationary training of such officers. Further, as soon as they are posted in a district, the SLBC may arrange for exposure visits for the District Collectors to the SLBC Convenor's office
