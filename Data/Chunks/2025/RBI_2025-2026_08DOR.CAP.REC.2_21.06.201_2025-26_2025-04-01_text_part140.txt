 value of any collateral) terminated and closed out under it so that a single net amount is owed by one party to the other;
- c) allow for the prompt liquidation or setoff of collateral upon the event of default; and
- d) be, together with the rights arising from the provisions required in (a) to (c) above, legally enforceable in each relevant jurisdiction upon the occurrence of an event of default and regardless of the counterparty's insolvency or bankruptcy.
- e) Netting across positions in the banking and trading book will only be recognised when the netted transactions fulfil the following conditions:
	- (i) All transactions are marked to market daily[269;](#page-304-1) and

(ii) The collateral instruments used in the transactions are recognised as eligible financial collateral in the banking book.

### **B. For Derivatives transactions**

(a) Banks may net transactions subject to novation under which any obligation between a bank and its counterparty to deliver a given currency on a given value date is automatically amalgamated with all other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substituting one single amount for the previous gross obligations.

(b) Banks may also net transactions subject to any legally valid form of bilateral netting not covered in (a), including other forms of novation.

<span id="page-304-1"></span> <sup>269</sup> The holding period for the haircuts will depend as in other repo-style transactions on the frequency of margining.

- (c) In both cases (a) and (b), a bank will need to satisfy that it has:
	- (i) A netting contract or agreement[270](#page-305-0) with the counterparty which creates a single legal obligation, covering all included transactions, such that the bank would have either a claim to receive or obligation to pay only the net sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values of included individual transactions in the event a counterparty fails to perform due to any of the following: default, bankruptcy, liquidation or similar circumstances;
	- (ii) Written and reasoned legal opinions that, in the event of a legal challenge, the relevant courts and administrative authorities would find the bank's exposure to be such a net amount under:
		- The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered and, if the foreign branch of a counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;
		- The law that governs the individual transactions; and
		- The law that governs any contract or agreement necessary to effect the netting.
	- (iii) Procedures in place to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting arrangements are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.

(d) Contracts containing walkaway clauses will not be eligible for netting for the purpose of calculating capital requirements under these guidelines. A walkaway clause is a provision which permits a non-defaulting counterparty to make only limited payments or no payment at all, to the estate of a defaulter, even if the defaulter is a net creditor.
