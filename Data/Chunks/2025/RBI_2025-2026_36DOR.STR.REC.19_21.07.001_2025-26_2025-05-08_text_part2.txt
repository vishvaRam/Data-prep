- ii. RE shall conduct enhanced due diligence before they enter into an agreement with a LSP for digital lending, taking into account LSP's technical capabilities, robustness of data privacy policies and storage systems, fairness in conduct with borrowers, past records of conduct and ability to comply with all applicable regulations and statutes.

<span id="page-4-2"></span><sup>1</sup> While entities offering only Payment Aggregator (PA) services in terms of the extant instructions issued by RBI shall remain out of the ambit of these Directions, any PA also performing the role of an LSP shall comply with these Directions.

- iii. RE shall carry out periodic review of the conduct of the LSP vis-à-vis the terms of the contractual agreement and shall take appropriate action in the event of any deviation therefrom.
- iv. RE shall lay down, as part of its policy, suitable monitoring mechanisms for the loan portfolios originated with the support of LSPs.
- v. RE shall impart necessary guidance to LSP acting as a recovery agent, to discharge their duties responsibly and ensure that LSP complies with the applicable instructions[2](#page-5-1) in this regard.
- vi. RE shall continue to conform to the extant guidelines on outsourcing[3](#page-5-2) and shall ensure that the LSPs engaged by them and the DLAs (either of the RE or of the LSPs engaged by the RE) comply with these Directions.
- vii. As an overarching principle, any outsourcing agreement entered into by the RE with an LSP shall in no manner dilute or absolve the RE of its obligations under any statutory or regulatory provision, and the RE shall remain fully responsible and liable for all acts and omissions of the LSP.
