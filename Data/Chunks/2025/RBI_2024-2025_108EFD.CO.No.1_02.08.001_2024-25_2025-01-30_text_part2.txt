- (vi) In case the amount of resultant penalty affects the viability of the contravener or is otherwise disproportionate or unfair, or where neither the extent of impact nor the intent of committing the contravention is clearly established, the designated authority may exercise discretion and take a fair view to either reduce or impose an appropriate amount of penalty, subject to statutory limits.
