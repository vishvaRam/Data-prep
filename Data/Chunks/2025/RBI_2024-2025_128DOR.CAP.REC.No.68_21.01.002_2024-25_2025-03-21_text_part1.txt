Dear Sir/Madam,

## **Treatment of Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset for Regulatory Capital Purposes**

Please refer to:

- a) Paragraphs 5.1.25 and 107.2 of the [Master Direction Reserve Bank of India](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12550)  [\(Non-Banking Financial Company \(NBFC\) – Scale Based Regulation\) Directions,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12550)  [2023](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12550) - (*definition of Owned Fund and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital)*

- c) Paragraph 3.(1)(xxii) of the [Core Investment Companies \(Reserve Bank\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10564)  [Directions, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10564) – (*definition of Owned Fund*)
- d) Paragraph 3(a)(xxv) of the [Mortgage Guarantee Companies \(Reserve Bank\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10690)  [Directions, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10690) – (*definition of Owned Fund*)
- e) Paragraph 3.1(xi) of the [Master Direction Reserve Bank of India \(Asset](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12669)  [Reconstruction Companies\) Directions, 2024](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12669) – (*definition of Owned Fund*)
- f) Paragraph 3(iv) of the [Master Direction Standalone Primary Dealers \(Reserve](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10567)  [Bank\) Directions, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10567) – (*definition of Tier 1 capital*)

The instructions cited above require deducting the book value of intangible assets while calculating Owned Fund/ CET 1 capital/ Tier 1 capital.

2. In terms of Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS) 116 - Leases, most leases will be reflected on a lessee's balance sheet as an obligation to make lease payments (a liability) and a related ROU asset (an asset). We have received references from various NBFCs (in their capacity as lessees) on the treatment of ROU assets for calculation of regulatory capital/ Owned Fund.

3. In this regard, it is clarified that regulated entities shall not be required to deduct an ROU asset (created in terms of Ind AS 116-Leases) from Owned Fund/ CET 1 capital/ Tier 1 capital (as the case may be), provided the underlying asset being taken on lease is a tangible asset. The ROU asset shall be risk-weighted at 100 per cent, consistent with the risk weight applied historically to the owned tangible assets.

4. The above revisions/changes have been incorporated in the respective Master Directions, as [detailed](#page-2-0) in Annexure 1 to Annexure to 6 below.

### **Applicability**

5. This circular is applicable, with immediate effect, to all NBFCs (including HFCs) and Asset Reconstruction Companies implementing Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015.

Yours faithfully,

(Usha Janakiraman) Chief General Manager-in-Charge
