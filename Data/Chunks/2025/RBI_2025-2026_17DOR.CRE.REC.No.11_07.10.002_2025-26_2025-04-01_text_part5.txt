y borrowers independently through their own advocates / solicitors. Banks should, therefore, take due precaution while accepting various documents.

9.2 Banks shall satisfy themselves that loans extended by them are not for unauthorized construction or for misuse of properties / encroachment on public land. For this purpose, they should ensure strict compliance with the procedure laid down in [Annex 2.](#page-14-0)

9.3 In a case which came up before the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, the Hon'ble Court observed that the bank granting finance to housing / development projects should insist on disclosure of the charge / or any other liability on the plot, in the brochure, pamphlets etc., which may be published by developer / owner inviting public at large to purchase flats and properties. The Court also added that this obviously would be part of the terms and conditions on which the loan may be sanctioned by the bank. Keeping in view the above observations, while granting finance for eligible housing schemes, UCBs are advised to stipulate as part of terms and conditions that:

(a) The builder / developer shall disclose in the pamphlets / brochures etc., the name(s) of the bank(s) to which the property is mortgaged.

(b) The builder / developer would append the information relating to mortgage while advertising for a particular scheme in newspapers / magazines etc.

(c) The builder / developer would indicate in the pamphlets / brochures that he would provide No Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee bank for sale of flats / property, if required. UCBs are advised to ensure compliance of the above terms and conditions. Funds should not be released unless the builder / developer fulfils the above requirements.

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) formulates comprehensive building Code namely National Building Code (NBC) of India providing guidelines for regulating the building construction activities across the country. The Code, updated from time to time contains all the important aspects relevant to safe and orderly building development such as administrative regulations, development control rules and general building requirements; fire safety requirements; stipulations regarding materials, structural design and construction (including safety); and building and plumbing services. Adherence to NBC will be advisable in view of the importance of safety of buildings especially against natural disasters. Banks' boards may consider this aspect for incorporation in their loan policies. Further information regarding the NBC can be accessed from the website of Bureau of Indian Standards [\(http://www.bis.gov.in/\).](https://www.bis.gov.in/)

## <span id="page-10-0"></span>**Definition of Commercial Real Estate Exposure (CRE)**

(vide paragraph 4.8.5)

Real Estate is generally defined as an immovable asset - land (earth space) and the permanently attached improvements to it. Income-producing real estate (IPRE) is defined in para 226 of the Basel II Framework as under:

"Income-producing real estate (IPRE) refers to a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The borrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPE (Special Purpose Entity), an operating company focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with sources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus other corporate exposures that are collateralised by real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment of the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on the cash flows generated by a property".

2. The Income Producing Real Estate (IPRE) is synonymous with Commercial Real Estate (CRE). From the definition of IPRE given above, it may be seen that for an exposure to be classified as IPRE / CRE, the essential feature would be that the funding will result in the creation / acquisition of real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment would depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. Additionally, the prospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows generated from such funded asset which is taken as security, as would generally be the case. The primary source of cash flow (i.e., more than 50% of cash flows) for repayment would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as a
