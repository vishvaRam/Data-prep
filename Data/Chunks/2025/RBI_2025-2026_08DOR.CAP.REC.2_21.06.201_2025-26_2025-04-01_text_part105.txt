## **1.10 Loss Absorption Features**

PDIs may be classified as liabilities for accounting purposes (not for the purpose of insolvency as indicated in paragraph 1.9 above). In such cases, these instruments must have principal loss absorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at an objective pre-specified trigger point or (ii) a write-down mechanism which allocates losses to the instrument at a pre-specified trigger point. The write-down will have the following effects:

- a) Reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;
- b) Reduce the amount re-paid when a call is exercised; and
- c) Partially or fully reduce coupon payments on the instrument.

Various criteria for loss absorption through conversion / write-down / write-off on breach of prespecified trigger and at the point of non-viability are furnished in **[Annex 15.](#page-259-0)**

### **1.11 Prohibition on Purchase / Funding of Instruments**
