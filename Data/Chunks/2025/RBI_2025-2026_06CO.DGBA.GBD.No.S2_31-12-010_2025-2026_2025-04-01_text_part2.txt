In this context, the 'Receipts-e-mode transactions' indicated against Sr. No. a.(ii) in the above table refer to those transactions involving remittance of funds from the remitter's bank account through Internet banking as well as such transactions which do not involve physical receipt of cash /instruments at all. For example, challan

generated electronically and submitted to agency bank along with cash / instrument should be treated as transaction under physical mode.

15. With reference to the implementation of GST regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission effective July 1, 2017.

16. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even
