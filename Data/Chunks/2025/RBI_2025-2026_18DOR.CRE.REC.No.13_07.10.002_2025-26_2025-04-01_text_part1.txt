### <span id="page-2-0"></span>**1. Introduction**

Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are expected to lay down, with the approval of their boards, transparent policies and guidelines for credit dispensation, in respect of each broad category of economic activity, keeping in view the credit exposure norms and various other guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time.

In order to ensure that the loan policy of the UCB reflects approved internal risk appetite and remains in alignment with the extant regulations, it shall be reviewed by the Board at least once in a financial year.

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**2. Working Capital Requirements**

2.1 The assessment of working capital requirement of borrowers, other than micro and small enterprises, requiring fund based working capital limits up to ₹1 crore and micro and small enterprises requiring fund based working capital limits up to ₹5 crore from the banking system may be made on the basis of their projected annual turnover.

2.2 In accordance with these guidelines, the working capital requirement is to be assessed at 25% of the projected turnover to be shared between the borrower and the UCB, viz. borrower contributing 5% of the turnover as Net Working Capital (NWC) and UCB providing finance at a minimum of 20% of the turnover. Projected turnover may be interpreted as 'Gross Sales' including excise duty.

2.3 The UCBs may, at their discretion, carry out the assessment based on projected turnover basis or the traditional method. If the credit requirement based on traditional production / processing cycle is higher than the one assessed on projected turnover basis, the same may be sanctioned, as borrower must be financed up to the extent of minimum 20% of their projected annual turnover. The projected annual turnover would be estimated on the basis of annual statements of accounts or other documents such as returns filed with sales-tax / revenue authorities. Actual drawals may be allowed on the basis of drawing power to be determined by UCBs after excluding unpaid stocks.

2.4 Drawals against the limits should be allowed against the usual safeguards including drawing power and it is to be ensured that the same are used for the purpose intended. UCBs will have to ensure regular and timely submission of monthly statements of stocks, receivables, etc., by the borrowers and also periodical verification of such statements *vis-à-vis* physical stocks by their officials.

2.5 In respect of borrowers other than micro and small enterprises, requiring working capital limits above ₹1 crore and for micro and small enterprises/units requiring fund based working capital limits above ₹5 crore, UCBs may determine the working capital requirements according to their perception of the credit needs of borrowers. UCBs may adopt turnover method or cash budgeting method or any other method as considered necessary. However, UCBs may ensure that the bookdebt finance does not exceed 75% of the limits sanctioned to borrowers for financing inland credit sales. The remaining 25% of the credit sales may be financed through bills to ensure greater use of bills for financing sales.
