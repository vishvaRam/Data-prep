Therefore, these investments have been subjected to stringent treatment in terms of deduction from respective tiers of regulatory capital. A schematic representation of treatment of banks' investments in capital instruments of financial entities is shown in **Figure 1** below. Accordingly, all investments[20](#page-26-0) in the capital instruments issued by banking, financial and insurance entities within the limits mentioned in **paragraph 4.4.9.1** will be subject to the following rules:
