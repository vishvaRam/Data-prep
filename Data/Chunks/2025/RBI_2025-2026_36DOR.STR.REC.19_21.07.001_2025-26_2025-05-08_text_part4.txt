This shall also cover co-lending arrangements between REs for non-PSL loans subject to the condition that no third party other than the REs in a co-lending transaction shall have direct or indirect control over the flow of funds at any point of time. <sup>7</sup> Advances against salary, where the loan is disbursed directly to the bank account of the borrower but the repayment is from the corporate employer, can be allowed subject to the condition that the loan is repaid by the corporate employer by deducting the amount from the borrower's salary.

In order to afford operational flexibility to RE, such transactions are exempted from the requirement of direct repayment of loan in the RE's bank account. However, any recovery by cash shall be duly reflected in full in the borrower's account on the same day and RE shall ensure that any fees, charges, etc., payable to LSPs for such recovery are paid directly by the RE and are not charged by LSP to the borrower either directly or indirectly from the recovery proceeds.
