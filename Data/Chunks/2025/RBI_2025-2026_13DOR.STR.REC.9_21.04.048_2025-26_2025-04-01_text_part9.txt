nes prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 of this circular. Financing of cost overrun beyond the ceiling prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 of this circular would be treated as an event of restructuring even if the extension of DCCO is within the limits prescribed above;

h) While considering the extension of DCCO (up to an additional period of 2 years) for the benefits envisaged hereinabove, banks shall make sure that the repayment schedule does not extend beyond 85 per cent of the economic life/concession period of the project; and

i) This facility would be available to a project only once before achievement of DCCO and will not be available during subsequent change in ownership, if any.

4.2.15.3.4 Loans covered under this guideline would attract provisioning as per the extant provisioning norms depending upon their asset classification status.

#### *4.2.15.4 Deemed DCCO*

4.2.15.4.1 A project with multiple independent units may be deemed to have commenced commercial operations from the date when the independent units representing 50 per cent (or higher) of the originally envisaged capacity have commenced commercial production of the final output as originally envisaged, subject to the following conditions:

- a. The units representing remaining 50 per cent (or lower) of the originally envisaged capacity shall commence commercial operations within a maximum period of one year from the deemed date of commencement of commercial operations;
- b. Commercial viability of the project is reassessed beyond doubt; and
- c. Capitalisation of interest obligation in respect of project debt component attributable to the units of the plant which have commenced commercial

operations has to cease and the revenue expenditure is booked under revenue account.

4.2.15.4.2 In such cases, banks may, at their discretion, also effect a consequential shift in repayment schedule of the debt attributable to units which have not commenced commercial operations for equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) i.e., one year, subject to no other changes being carried out.

4.2.15.4.3 If the remaining units do not commence commercial operations within the stipulated time of one year at paragraph 4.2.15.4.1 (a) above, the account shall be treated as non-performing asset and the provisions shall be made accordingly.

#### *4.2.15.5 Financing of Cost Overruns for Projects under Implementation*

4.2.15.5.1 Internationally, project finance lenders sanction a 'standby credit facility' to fund cost overruns if needed. Such 'standby credit facilities' are sanctioned at the time of initial financial closure; but disbursed only when there is a cost overrun. At the time of credit assessment of borrowers/project, such cost overruns are also taken into account while determining the project Debt Equity Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Fixed Asset Coverage Ratio etc. Such 'standby credit facilities' rank *pari passu* with base project loans and their repayment schedule is also the same as that of the base project loans.

4.2.15.5.2 Accordingly, in cases where banks have specifically sanctioned a 'standby facility' at the time of initial financial closure to fund cost overruns, they may fund cost overruns as per the agreed terms and conditions.

4.2.15.5.3 Where the initial financial closure does not envisage such financing of cost overruns, banks are allowed to fund cost overruns, which may arise on account of extension of DCCO up to two years and one year from the original DCCO stipulated at the time of financial closure for infrastructure projects and non-infrastructure projects (including commercial real estate projects) respectively, without treating the loans as 'restructured asset', subject to the following conditions:

a) Banks may fund additional 'Interest During Construction', which may arise on account of delay in completion of a project;

b) Other cost overruns (excluding Interest During Construction) up to a maximum of 10% of the original project cost;

c) The Debt Equity Ratio as agreed at the time of initial financial closure should remain unchanged subsequent to funding cost overruns or improve in favour of the lenders and the revised Debt Service Coverage Ratio should be acceptable to the lenders;

d) Disbursement of funds for cost overruns should start only after the Sponsors/Promoters bring in their share of funding of the cost overruns; and

e) All other terms and conditions of the loan should remain unchanged or enhanced in favour of the lenders.

4.2.15.5.4 The ceiling of 10 per cent of the original project cost prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15.5.3 (b) above is applicable to financing of all other cost overruns (excluding interest during construction), including cost overruns on account of fluctuations in the value of Indian Rupee against other currencies, arising out of extension of date of commencement of commercial operations.
