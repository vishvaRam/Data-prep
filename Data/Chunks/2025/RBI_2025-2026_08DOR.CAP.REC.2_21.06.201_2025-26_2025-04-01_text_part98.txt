discretionary repurchases / buy backs or other means of effectively reducing capital in a discretionary manner that is allowable under relevant law as well as guidelines, if any, issued by RBI in the matter).

5. The bank does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the instrument will be bought back, redeemed or cancelled nor do the statutory or contractual terms provide any feature which might give rise to such an expectation.

6. Distributions are paid out of distributable items. The level of distributions is not in any way tied or linked to the amount paid up at issuance and is not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that a bank is unable to pay distributions that exceed the level of distributable items). As regards 'distributable items', it is clarified that the dividend on common shares will be paid out of current year's profit only.

7. There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non-payment is therefore not an event of default.

8. Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been met and payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This means that there are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other elements classified as the highest quality issued capital.

9. It is the paid-up capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any losses as they occur[172](#page-185-0). Within the highest quality capital, each instrument absorbs losses on a going concern basis proportionately and *pari passu* with all the others.

10. The paid up amount is classified as equity capital (i.e. not recognised as a liability) for determining balance sheet insolvency.

11. The paid up amount is classified as equity under the relevant accounting standards.

12. It is directly issued and paid up and the bank cannot directly or indirectly have funded the purchase of the instrument[173](#page-185-1). Banks should also not extend loans against their own shares.

13. The paid up amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or related entity[174](#page-185-2) nor subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the claim.

14. Paid up capital is only issued with the approval of the owners of the issuing bank, either given directly by the owners or, if permitted by applicable law, given by the Board of Directors or by other persons duly authorised by the owners.

15. Paid up capital is clearly and separately disclosed in the bank's balance sheet.
