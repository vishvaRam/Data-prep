(x) Banks may reckon the profits in current financial year for CRAR calculation on a quarterly basis provided the incremental provisions made for non-performing assets at the end of any of the four quarters of the previous financial year have not deviated more than 25% from the average of the four quarters. The amount which can be reckoned would be arrived at by using the following formula:

EPt= {NPt – 0.25\*D\*t}

where;

EPt = Eligible profit up to the quarter 't' of the current financial year; t varies from 1 to 4

NPt = Net profit up to the quarter 't'

D= average annual dividend paid during last three years

It is clarified that the cumulative net loss up to the quarter end must be deducted while calculating CET1 capital for the relevant quarter.
