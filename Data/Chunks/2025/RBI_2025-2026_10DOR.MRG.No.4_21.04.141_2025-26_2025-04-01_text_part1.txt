#### <span id="page-1-0"></span>**FAQs on Reserve Bank of India (Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of Commercial Banks) Directions, 2023**

#### **Q.No.1: Can investments in bonds with a put option be classified under the HTM category?**

*[Refer Chapter III to the Directions]*

Ans:

- a. For a security to be classified under HTM category, contractual terms of the security should give rise to cash flows that meets the SPPI criterion and the security must be acquired with the intention and objective of holding it to maturity. Accordingly, the bond with put option meeting these criteria can be classified under HTM.
- b. Exercise of put option, prior to maturity, is generally not consistent with the intention and objective of holding to maturity and, therefore, may be treated as sale out of HTM. However, if the put option is exercised in scenarios such as a downgrade in credit ratings or default by the counterparty, the intention and objective of holding to maturity may not be considered as vitiated.

### **Q.No.2: How should the fair value of investments at initial recognition be determined?**

#### *[Refer Clauses 7 and 23 of Directions]*

Ans: In terms of clause 7 of the Directions, all investments shall be measured at fair value on initial recognition.

In cases where this presumption does not hold, the fair value of investments at initial recognition shall be determined in terms of Chapter VIII of the Directions.

**Q.No.4: Clause 36(a)(v) of the Directions prescribe that in case of conversion of principal and/or interest into equity shares, debentures, bonds, etc., such instruments shall be classified in the same asset classification category as the loan and provision shall be made as per the norms.
