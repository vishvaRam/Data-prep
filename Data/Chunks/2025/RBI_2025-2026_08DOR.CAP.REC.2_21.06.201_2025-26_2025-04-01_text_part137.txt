- b. the light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section.

(Rs. in million)


<span id="page-280-0"></span> <sup>255</sup> Not Applicable to commercial banks in India.

<span id="page-280-1"></span><sup>256</sup> In terms of Basel III rules text issued by the Basel Committee (December 2010), DTAs that rely on future profitability of the bank to be realized are to be deducted. DTAs which relate to temporary differences are to be treated under the "threshold deductions" as set out in paragraph 87.

<span id="page-280-2"></span><sup>257</sup> Only significant investments other than in the insurance and non-financial subsidiaries should be reported here. The insurance and non-financial subsidiaries are not consolidated for the purpose of capital adequacy. The equity and other regulatory capital investments in insurance subsidiaries are fully deducted from consolidated regulatory


capital of the banking group. However, in terms of Basel III rules text of the Basel Committee, insurance subsidiaries are included under significant investments and thus, deducted based on 10% threshold rule instead of full deduction. <sup>258</sup> Not applicable in Indian context.

<span id="page-281-1"></span><span id="page-281-0"></span><sup>259</sup> Please refer to Footnote 246 above.

<span id="page-281-2"></span><sup>260</sup> Adjustments which are not specific to the Basel III regulatory adjustments (as prescribed by the Basel Committee) will be reported under this row. However, regulatory adjustments which are linked to Basel III i.e., where there is a change in the definition of the Basel III regulatory adjustments, the impact of these changes will be explained in the Notes of this disclosure template.

<span id="page-281-3"></span><sup>261</sup> Non-financial subsidiaries are not consolidated for the purpose of capital adequacy. The equity and other regulatory capital investments in the non-financial subsidiaries are deducted from consolidated regulatory capital of the group. These investments are not required to be deducted fully from capital under Basel III rules text of the Basel Committee.

<span id="page-281-4"></span><sup>262</sup> Please refer to paragraph 3.4.5 of this Master Circular. Please also refer to the Paragraph 34 of the Basel II Framework issued by the Basel Committee (June 2006). Though this is not national specific adjustment, it is reported here.
