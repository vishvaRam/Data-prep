nts'.

Banks were further advised to ensure that opening of bank accounts and seeding of Aadhaar numbers with existing or new accounts of eligible beneficiaries opened for the purpose of DBT under social welfare schemes, was in conformity with the provisions listed under Section 16 of the Master Direction - [Know Your Customer](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566)  [\(KYC\) Direction, 2016](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) (updated as on May 10, 2021) and extant provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering (PML) Rules.

#### **8. Service Area Approach (SAA)**

i) The Service Area Approach (SAA) introduced in April 1989 for planned and orderly development of rural and semi-urban areas was applicable to all SCBs including RRBs. Under SAA, each bank branch in a rural or semi-urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages and the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of its service area. The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.

ii) The SAA scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme, while retaining the positive features of the SAA, such as, credit planning and monitoring of the credit purveyance. Accordingly, under SAA, the allocation of villages among the rural and semi-urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under Government Sponsored Schemes. Thus, while the commercial banks and RRBs are free to lend in any rural and semi-urban area, the borrowers have the choice of approaching any branch for their credit requirements.

## **8.1 Dispensing with 'No Due Certificate'**

In order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semi-urban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different ways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to dispense with obtaining a 'No Due Certificate' from individual borrowers (including SHGs and JLGs) in rural and semi-urban areas for all types of loans, including loans under Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount involved unless the

Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a 'No Due Certificate'. Further, it has been clarified that the policy of dispensing with a 'No Due Certificate' for lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including metropolitan cities.

ii) Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part of the credit appraisal exercise other than the 'No Due Certificate' which could, among others, consist of one or more of the following:

- Credit history check through Credit Information Companies (CICs)
- Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower
- CERSAI registration
- Peer monitoring
- Information sharing among lenders
- Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)
- iii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all CICs, as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.

# **9. Enhancing Farmers' Income**

i) The Government of India, in the Union Budget 2016-17, had announced its resolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps were taken towards attaining this objective, including setting up of an inter-ministerial committee for preparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda was reiterated by the government in several fora and acquired primacy from the point of view of rural and agricultural development.

ii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter-alia, includes,

- Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of "per drop, more crop".
- Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field.
- Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post-harvest crop losses.
- Promotion of value addition through food processing.
- Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and development of infrastructure such as e-platform across 585 stations.
- Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable cost.
- Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee-keeping and fisheries.
- Diversification towards high value crops needs to be promoted at district level, accordingly value chain needs to be developed for those high value crops.
- Creation of a Start-up Ecosystem in agriculture and allied sector.
- Promotion of organic farming in the country.

iii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly dependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should revisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure speedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.
