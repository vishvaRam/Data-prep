#### 2.1.6 Classification as Special Mention Account (SMA) and **Reporting of Large Exposures to Central Repository of Information on Large Credits (CRILC) - UCBs**

SMA is an account which is exhibiting signs of incipient stress resulting in the borrower defaulting in timely servicing of her debt obligations, though the account has not yet been classified as NPA. As early recognition of such accounts enables banks to initiate timely remedial actions to prevent their potential slippages into NPAs, all UCBs shall classify loans/advances accounts as SMA, as under:

## **2.2 Treatment of Accounts as NPAs**

### **2.2.1 Record of Recovery**

(i) The treatment of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery. Banks should not treat an advance as NPA merely due to existence of some deficiencies which are temporary in nature such as nonavailability of adequate drawing power, balance outstanding exceeding the limit, non-submission of stock statements and the non-renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. Where there is a threat of loss, or the recoverability of the advances is in doubt, the asset should be treated as NPA.

(ii) A credit facility should be treated as NPA as per norms given in paragraph 2.1 above. However, where entire overdues pertaining to all the credit facilities availed by a borrower from a given bank have been regularised by repayment through genuine sources (not by sanction of additional facilities or transfer of funds between accounts), the accounts may be upgraded to 'standard' asset category. In such cases, it should, however, be ensured that the accounts
