ents subject to the restriction on distributions mentioned at (i) above. Earnings are calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impact of making such distributions are reversed out. If a bank does not have positive earnings and has a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio less than 8%, it should not make positive net distributions.

(iii) **Solo or consolidated application**: Capital conservation buffer is applicable both at the solo level (global position) as well as at the consolidated level, i.e., restrictions would be imposed on distributions at the level of both the solo bank and the consolidated group. In all cases where the bank is the parent of the group, it would mean that distributions by the bank can be made only in accordance with the lower of its Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio at solo level or consolidated level[129.](#page-166-2) For example, if a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.8% and that at consolidated level is 7.4%. It will be subject to a capital conservation requirement of 60% consistent with the Common Equity Tier 1 range of >6.75% - 7.375% as per **Table 22** in paragraph 15.2.1 above. Suppose a bank's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at solo level is 6.6% and that at consolidated level is 6%. It will be subject to a capital conservation requirement of 100% consistent with the Common Equity Tier 1 range of >5.5% - 6.125% as per **Table 22** on minimum capital conservation standards for individual bank.

# <span id="page-166-0"></span>**16. Leverage Ratio**

# **16.1 Rationale and Objective**

An underlying cause of the global financial crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive leverage while apparently maintaining strong risk-based capital ratios. During the most severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices. This deleveraging process exacerbated the feedback loop between losses, falling bank capital and contraction in credit availability. Therefore, under Basel III, a simple, transparent, non-risk based leverage ratio has been introduced. The leverage ratio

If it is not a bank, even then the parent bank should not allow the subsidiary to distribute dividend which are inconsistent with the position of CCB at the consolidated level.

is calibrated to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk based capital requirements and is intended to achieve the following objectives:

(a) constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector to avoid destabilising deleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the economy; and

(b) reinforce the risk-based requirements with a simple, non-risk based "backstop" measure.

# **16.2 Definition, Minimum Requirement and Scope of Application of the Leverage Ratio**

# *Definition and minimum requirement*

16.2.1 The Basel III leverage ratio is defined as the capital measure (the numerator) divided by the exposure measure (the denominator), with this ratio expressed as a percentage.

16.2.2 The minimum Leverage Ratio shall be 4% for Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D-SIBs) and 3.5% for other banks[131](#page-167-0). Both the capital measure and the exposure measure along with Leverage Ratio are to be disclosed on a quarter-end basis. However, banks must meet the minimum Leverage Ratio requirement at all times.

# *Scope of consolidation*

16.2.3 The Basel III leverage ratio framework follows the same scope of regulatory consolidation as is used for the risk-based capital framework[132.](#page-167-1)

16.2.4 *Treatment of investments in the capital of banking, financial, insurance and commercial entities that are outside the regulatory scope of consolidation*: in cases where a banking, financial, insurance or commercial entity is outside the scope of regulatory consolidation, only the investment in the capital of such entities (i.e. only the carrying value of the investment, as opposed to the underlying assets and other exposures of the investee) is to be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure. However, investments in the capital of such entities that are deducted from Tier 1 capi
