\* The deduction should be made from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.

#### **Notes:**

- (i) In the case of banks where no capital adequacy norms have been prescribed by the RBI, the lending / investing bank may calculate the CRAR of the cooperative bank concerned, notionally, by obtaining necessary information from the investee bank, using the capital adequacy norms as applicable to the commercial banks. In case, it is not found feasible to compute CRAR on such notional basis, the risk weight of 350 or 625 per cent, as per the risk perception of the investing bank, should be applied uniformly to the investing bank's entire exposure.
- (ii) In case of banks where capital adequacy norms are not applicable at present, the matter of investments in their capital-eligible instruments would not arise for now. However, this Table above will become applicable to them, if in future they issue any capital instruments where other banks are eligible to invest.
- (iii) Till such time the investee banks have not disclosed their Basel III capital ratios publicly, the risk weights / capital charges shall be arrived at based on the applicable tables / paragraph as contained in the [Master Circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9893)  [DBOD.No.BP.BC.4/21.06.001/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9893) on Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Market Discipline - New Capital Adequacy Framework.

**Table 4: Claims on Foreign Banks â€“ Risk Weights**

The exposures of the Indian branches of foreign banks, guaranteed / counter-guaranteed by the overseas Head Offices or the bank's branch in another country shall amount to a claim on the parent foreign bank if exposure is reckoned as per prudential norms on the foreign bank's branch / Head office and shall also attract the risk weights as per Table 4 above. If bank reckons the exposure on the original counterparty, it shall attract the risk weight as per Table 5, if the counterparty is a person resident in India, or 150%[34](#page-38-0) if the counterparty is a person resident outside India.
