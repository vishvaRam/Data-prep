### **3. QUANTUM OF LOAN**

(a) While deciding the quantum of loan to be granted as housing finance, banks should abide by the following Loan to Value (LTV) and Risk Weights (RWs):


As a counter cyclical measure, for Individual Housing Loans sanctioned on or after October 16, 2020 and up to March 31, 2023, the risk weights shall be as per the [circular DOR.No.BP.BC.24/08.12.015/2020-21 dated October 16, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11984&Mode=0) on 'Individual Housing Loans – Rationalisation of Risk Weights'. The risk weights are as under -


(b) In order to have uniformity in the practices adopted for deciding the value of the house property while sanctioning housing loans, banks should not include stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges in the cost of the housing property they finance so that the effectiveness of LTV norms is not diluted.

(c) However, in cases where the cost of the house/dwelling units does not exceed Rs.10 lakh, bank may add stamp duty, registration and other documentation charges to the cost of the house/dwelling unit for the purpose of calculating LTV ratio.

# **4. INNOVATIVE HOUSING LOAN PRODUCTS – UPFRONT DISBURSAL OF HOUSING LOANS**

(a) It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing Loan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g., upfront disbursal of sanctioned individual housing loans to the builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of construction of housing project, Interest/EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period/ specified period, etc. This might include signing of tripartite agreement between the bank, the builder and the buyer of the housing unit. These loans products are popularly known by various names like 80:20, 75:25 schemes.

(b) Such housing loan products are likely to expose the banks as well as their home loan borrowers to additional risks e.g., in case of dispute between individual borrowers and developers/builders, default/ delayed payment of interest/ EMI by the developer/ builder during the agreed period on behalf of the borrower, non-completion of the project on time etc. Further, any delayed payments by developers/ builders on behalf of individual borrowers to banks may lead to lower credit rating/ scoring of such borrowers by credit information companies (CICs) as information about servicing of loans get passed on to the CICs on a regular basis. In cases, where bank loans are also disbursed upfront on behalf of their individual borrowers in a lump-sum to builders/ developers without any linkage to stages of constructions, banks run disproportionately higher exposures with concomitant risks of diversion of funds.

(c) Disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under-construction / green field housing projects.

(d) However, in cases of projects sponsored by Government/Statutory Authorities, banks may disburse the loans as per the payment stages prescribed by such authorities, even where payments sought from house buyers are not linked to the stages of constructions, provided such authorities have no past history of noncompletion of projects.

(e) It is emphasized that banks while introducing any kind of product should take into account the customer suitability and appropriateness issues and also ensure that the

borrowers/ customers are made fully aware of the risks and liabilities under such products.

# **5. RATE OF INTEREST**

(a) Banks should charge interest on housing finance granted by them in accordance with the provisions contained in the [Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India \(Interest](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10295)  [Rate on Advances\) Directions, 2016,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10295) as amended from time to time.

(b) Banks shall ensure adherence to the instructions issued vide [Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12529&Mode=0)  [DOR.MCS.REC.32/01.01.003/2023-24 dated August 18, 2023](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12529&Mode=0) on 'Reset of Floating Interest Rate on Equated Monthly Instalments (EMI) based Personal Loans'.
