ning the services provided through BCs and for ensuring close supervision of BC operations. Accordingly, SLBC Convenor Banks were advised to identify villages with population above 5000 without a branch of a SCB in their State and allot these villages among SCBs (including RRBs) for opening of branches.

# **5.3 Aligning roadmap for unbanked villages having population more than 5000 with revised Guidelines on Branch Authorisation Policy**

In terms of the [DoR circular dated May 18, 2017 on 'Rationalisation of Branch](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10972&Mode=0)  Authorisation Policy - [Revision of Guidelines'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10972&Mode=0), final guidelines on 'Banking Outlets' have been issued to facilitate financial inclusion as also to provide flexibility to banks on the choice of delivery channel. Accordingly, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised to identify all unbanked rural centres (URCs) in the State, compile and maintain an updated list of all such centres. The updated list should be displayed on the website of each SLBC to facilitate banks to choose/indicate the place/centre where they wish to open a 'banking outlet'.

ii) Further, SLBC Convenor Banks have been advised that in order to comply with the criteria of opening at least 25 percent of total banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in Tier 5 and 6 centres, as prescribed vide DoR [circular dated May 18, 2017,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=10972&Mode=0) banks should give priority to villages without a banking outlet having population more than 5000 (i.e., Tier 5 centres) and ensure that all such villages under their jurisdiction are covered with a CBS-enabled Banking Outlet on priority basis.

iii) The updated list of URCs should be tabled in all SLBC meetings during discussions on the progress of providing banking services in unbanked rural centres.

# **5.4 National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019-2024 â€“ Universal Access to Financial Services**

Providing banking access to every village within a 5 KM radius/ hamlet of 500 households in hilly areas has been one of the key objectives of the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI): 2019-2024. Accordingly, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks have been advised to review the presence of banking outlets of SCBs, RRBs, Small Finance Banks (SFBs) and PBs in every village within a 5 KM radius/ hamlet of 500 households in hilly areas under their jurisdiction(s) and ensure that universal access to financial services is provided to all such villages.

## **6. Credit Deposit Ratio (CD Ratio)**

## **6.1 CD Ratio of Banks in Rural and Semi-Urban Areas**

Banks have been advised to achieve a CD Ratio of 60 percent in respect of their rural and semi-urban branches separately on an All-India basis. While it is not necessary that this ratio should be achieved separately, branch-wise, district-wise or region-wise, banks should, nevertheless, ensure that wide disparity in the ratios between different States/ Regions is avoided to minimise regional imbalance in credit deployment. The credit dispensation in certain districts is very low, due to various factors, such as, lack of necessary infrastructure, varying ability of different regions to absorb credit, etc. Banks may review the performance of their branches in such areas and take necessary steps to augment credit flow. The Lead Banks may discuss the problem in all its aspects with other financial institutions in the district and also in the DCC forum.

# **6.2 Implementation of the Recommendations of the Expert Group on CD Ratio**

i) An Expert Group was constituted by the Government of India to go into the nature and magnitude of the problem of low CD Ratio across States/ Regions and to suggest steps to overcome the problem. The Expert Group examined the problems and causes of low CD Ratio and made recommendations. As per the recommendations, the CD Ratio of banks should be monitored at different levels based on the following parameters:


Where:

Cu = Credit as per place of Utilization Cs# = Credit as per place of Sanction RIDF = Total Resource support provided to States under RIDF

# In case of credit proposals received at district level but not sanctionable thereat due to limitations of the sanctioning power and sanctioned at bank's Head office/ controlling offices and the loan utilised / disbursed in districts through branches, are treated as loan sanctioned and utilised at district level. Hence, it may be considered at district level for computing CD ratio.

As regards calculation of CD ratio based on limit sanctioned/ amount outstanding, it is clarified that the CD ratio may be calculated on the basis of amount outstanding.

Further, banks are advised that:

In districts having CD Ratio less than 40 percent, Special Sub-Committees (SSCs) of the DCC shall be set up to monitor the CD Ratio.

- Districts having CD Ratio between 40 and 60 percent
