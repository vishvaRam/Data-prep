hem first as sub-standard and then as doubtful after expiry of 12 months from the date the account has become NPA. Such accounts should be straight away classified as doubtful asset or loss asset, as appropriate, irrespective of the period for which they have remained as NPA.

## **3.3.2 Advances Granted under Rehabilitation Packages Approved by Term Lending Institutions**

(i) Banks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of which the terms have been re-negotiated unless the package of re-negotiated terms has worked satisfactorily for a period of one year. While the existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation packages approved by term lending institutions will continue to be classified as sub-standard or doubtful, as the case may be, in respect of additional facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation packages, the income recognition and asset classification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement.

(ii) A similar relaxation be made in respect of SSI units which are identified as sick by banks themselves and where rehabilitation packages / nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves or under consortium arrangements.

# **3.3.3 Internal System for Classification of Assets as NPA**

(i) Banks may adhere to the timelines for implementation of system-based asset classification mentioned at paragraph 2.1.4 above.

(ii) Banks, which are not required to implement system-based asset classficiation in terms of the instructions at paragraph 2.1.4, should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency to delay or postpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value accounts. The banks may fix a minimum cut-off point to decide what would constitute a high value account depending upon their respective business levels. The cut-off point should be valid for the entire accounting year.

(iii) Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed by the bank.

(iv) The system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are settled through specified internal channels within one month from the date on which the account would have been classified as NPA as per extant guidelines.

(v) Banks should ensure scrupulous compliance with the instructions for recognition of credit impairment and view aberrations by dealing officials seriously.

(vi) RBI would continue to identify the divergences arising due to non-compliance, for fixing accountability. Where there is wilful non-compliance by the official responsible for classification and is well documented, RBI would initiate deterrent action including imposition of monetary penalties.

## **4. Income Recognition**

## **4.1 Income Recognition - Policy**

4.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. Income from non-performing assets (NPA) is not recognised on accrual basis but is booked as income only when it is actually received. Therefore, banks should not take interest on non-performing assets to their income account on accrual basis.

4.1.2 However, interest on advances against term deposits, NSCs, KVPs and life insurance policies may be taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.

4.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of re-negotiations or rescheduling of outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered by the renegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.

4.1.4 If Government guaranteed advances remain 'overdue' for more than 90 days, the interest on such advances should not be taken to income account unless the interest has been realised. This shall be applicable in cases of both Central and State Government guaranteed accounts.

4.1.5 In cases of loans where moratorium has been granted for repayment of interest, banks may recognize interest income on accrual basis for accounts which continue to be classified as 'standard'. This shall be evaluated against the definition of 'restructured accounts' provided at sl.no. (iii) of [Annex-5](#page-30-0) to this Master Circular

# **4.2 Reversal of Income on Accounts Becoming NPAs**

4.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchased and discounted, becomes NPA, interest accrued and credited to income account, should be reversed or provided for, if the same is not realised This will also apply to Government guaranteed accounts which remain overdue for more than 90 days.

4.2.2 However, if loans with moratorium on payment of interest (permitted at the time of sanction of the loan) become NPA after the moratorium period is over, the capitalized interest, if any, corresponding to the interest accrued during such moratorium period need not be reversed.

4.2.3 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued should cease to accrue in th
