sensitivity and allow banks to select an approach that is most appropriate to the stage of development of bank's operations. The options available for computing capital for credit risk are Standardised Approach, Foundation Internal Rating Based Approach and Advanced Internal Rating Based Approach. The options available for computing capital for operational risk are Basic Indicator Approach (BIA), The Standardised Approach (TSA) and Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA).

2.2 Keeping in view the Reserve Bank's goal to have consistency and harmony with international standards, it was decided in 2007 that all commercial banks in India (excluding Local Area Banks and Regional Rural Banks) should adopt Standardised Approach for credit risk, Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk by March 2009 and banks should continue to apply the Standardised Duration Approach (SDA) for computing capital requirement for market risks.

2.3 Banks were advised to undertake an internal assessment of their preparedness for migration to advanced approaches and take a decision with the approval of their Boards, whether they would like to migrate to any of the advanced approaches. Based on bank's internal assessment and its preparation, a bank may choose a suitable date to apply for implementation of advanced approach. Besides, banks, at their discretion, would have the option of adopting the advanced approaches for one or more of the risk categories, as per their preparedness, while continuing with the simpler approaches for other risk categories, and it would not be necessary to adopt the advanced approaches for all the risk categories simultaneously. However, banks should invariably obtain prior approval of the RBI for adopting any of the advanced approaches.

**2.4 Effective Date**: The Basel III capital regulations were implemented in India with effect from April 1, 2013 and have been fully implemented as on October 1, 2021. Banks have to comply with the regulatory limits and minima as prescribed under Basel III capital regulations, on an ongoing basis.

**3.2** For the purpose of these directions, the subsidiary is an enterprise that is controlled by another enterprise (known as the parent). Banks will follow the definition of 'control' as given in the applicable accounting standards.

**3.3** The components, elements and eligibility criteria of the regulatory capital instruments for foreign banks operating in India under the Wholly Owned Subsidiary (WOS) model would be as applicable to the other domestic banks as stipulated in this Master Circular. The WOS shall meet the Basel III requirements on a continuous basis from the time of its entry / conversion. WOS shall, however, maintain a minimum capital adequacy ratio, on a continuous basis for an initial period of three years from the commencement of its operations, at 10 per cent.
