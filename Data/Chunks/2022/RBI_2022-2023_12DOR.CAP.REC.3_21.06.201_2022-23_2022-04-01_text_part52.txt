torts a bank's Pillar 1 capital charge, Reserve Bank will consider appropriate supervisory action under Pillar 2. The charge may be expressed as follows:

$$
KBIA = [\sum (Gl_{1...n} \times \alpha)]/n
$$

Where:

KBIA =the capital charge under the Basic Indicator Approach

- GI = annual gross income, where positive, over the previous three years
- n = number of the previous three years for which gross income is positive
- α = 15 per cent, which is set by the BCBS, relating the industry wide level of required capital to the industry wide level of the indicator.

9.3.2. Gross income is defined as "Net interest income" plus "net non-interest income". It is intended that this measure should:

- (i) be gross of any provisions (e.g., for unpaid interest) and write-offs made during the year;
- (ii) be gross of operating expenses, including fees paid to outsourcing service providers, *in addition to fees paid for services that are outsourced, fees received by banks that provide outsourcing services shall be included in the definition of gross income;*
- (iii) exclude reversal during the year in respect of provisions and write-offs made during the previous year(s);
- (iv) exclude income recognised from the disposal of items of movable and immovable property;
- (v) exclude realised profits/losses from the sale of securities in the *"held to maturity"* category;
- (vi) exclude income from legal settlements in favour of the bank;
- (vii) exclude other extraordinary or irregular items of income and expenditure; and
- (viii) exclude income derived from insurance activities (i.e., income derived by writing insurance policies) and insurance claims in favour of the bank.

9.3.3 Banks are advised to compute capital charge for operational risk under the Basic Indicator Approach as follows:

- (a) Average of [Gross Income \* alpha(α)] for each of the last three financial years, excluding years of negative or zero gross income as mentioned in *paragraph 9.3.1*.
- (b) Gross income = *Net profit (+) Provisions & contingencies (+) operating expenses (Schedule 16) (–) items (iii) to (viii) of paragraph 9.3.2*.

(c) Alpha (α) = 15 per cent

9.3.4 As a point of entry for capital calculation, no specific criteria for use of the Basic Indicator Approach are set out in these directions. Nevertheless, banks using this approach are encouraged to comply with the Basel Committee's guidance *'Principles for the Sound Management of Operational Risk'*, June 2011, and the *'Guidance Note on Management of Operational Risk'*, issued by the Reserve Bank of India in October 2005.

9.3.5 Once the bank has calculated the capital charge for operational risk under BIA, it has to multiply this with 12.5 and arrive at the notional risk weighted asset (RWA) for operational risk.

#### **Part B: Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)**

#### **10. Introduction to the SREP under Pillar 2**

10.1 The New Capital Adequacy Framework (NCAF), based on the Basel II Framework evolved by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, was adapted for India vide [Circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3464&Mode=0)  [DBOD.No.BP.BC.90/20.06.001/ 2006-07 dated April 27, 2007.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3464&Mode=0) In terms of paragraph 2.4 (iii)(c) of the Annex to the aforesaid circular banks were required to have a Board-approved policy on Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) and to assess the capital requirement as per ICAAP. It is presumed that banks would have formulated the policy and also undertaken the capital adequacy assessment accordingly.

10.2 The Capital Adequacy Framework rests on three components or three Pillars. Pillar 1 is the Minimum Capital Ratio while Pillar 2 and Pillar 3 are the Supervisory Review Process (SRP) and Market Discipline, respectively. The guidelines in regard to the SRP and the ICAAP are furnished in this Section. An illustrative outline of the format of the ICAAP document, to be submitted to the RBI, by banks, is furnished at **[Annex 15](#page--1-0)**.

10.3 The objective of the SRP is to ensure that banks have adequate capital to support all the risks in their business as also to encourage them to develop and use better risk management techniques for monitoring and managing their risks. This in turn would require a well-defined internal assessment process within banks through which they assure the RBI that adequate capital is indeed held towards the various risks to which they are exposed. The process of assurance could also involve an active dialogue between the bank and the RBI so that, when warranted, appropriate intervention could be made to either reduce the risk exposure of the bank or augment / restore its capital. Thus, ICAAP is an important component of the SRP.

10.4 The main aspects to be addressed under the SRP, and therefore, under the ICAAP, would include:

- (a) the risks that are not fully captured by the minimum capital ratio prescribe
