# **3 Composition of Capital Disclosure Templates**

## **3.1 Disclosure Template**

(i) The template is designed to capture the capital positions of banks. Certain rows are in *italics*. These rows will be deleted after all the ineligible capital instruments have been fully phased out (i.e., from April 1, 2022 onwards).

(ii) The reconciliation requirement in terms of paragraph 14.13 of this Master Circular results in the decomposition of certain regulatory adjustments. For example, the disclosure template below includes the adjustment of 'Goodwill net of related tax liability'. The requirements will lead to the disclosure of both the goodwill component and the related tax liability component of this regulatory adjustment.

(iii) Certain rows of the template are shaded as explained below:

- a. each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain component of regulatory capital.
- b. the light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section.
- c. the light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of regulatory capital and the capital ratios.

(iv) Also provided along with the Table, an explanation of each line of the template, with references to the appropriate paragraphs of this Master Circular.
