a monitoring mechanism, both at head office and regional/ zonal office levels to monitor non-disruptive implementation of the circular and to ensure that customers are not put to undue inconvenience during the implementation process.

5.4 Banks should not route drawal from term loans through CC/ OD/ Current accounts of the borrower. Since term loans are meant for specific purposes, the funds should be remitted directly to the supplier of goods and services. In cases where term loans are meant for purposes other than for supply of goods and services and where the payment destination is identifiable, banks shall ensure that payment is made directly, without routing it through an account of the borrower. However, where the payment destination is unidentifiable, banks may route such term loans through an account of the borrower opened as per the provisions of the circular. Expenses incurred by the borrower for day-to-day operations may be routed through an account of the borrower.
