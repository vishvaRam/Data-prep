norms should be segregated into an account styled as "countercyclical provisioning buffer", computation of which may be undertaken as per the format given in [Annex - 3;](#page--1-0) and
- (iii) this buffer will be allowed to be used by banks for making specific provisions for NPAs during periods of system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI.

5.10.4 The PCR of the bank should be disclosed in the Notes to Accounts to the Balance Sheet.

## 6. Writing-off of NPAs

# 6.1 General

6.1.1 In terms of Section 43(D) of the Income Tax Act 1961, income by way of interest in relation to such categories of bad and doubtful debts as may be prescribed having regard to the guidelines issued by the RBI in relation to such debts, shall be chargeable to tax in the previous year in which it is credited to the bank's profit and loss account or received, whichever is earlier.

6.1.2 This stipulation is not applicable to provisioning required to be made as indicated above. In other words, amounts set aside for making provision for NPAs as above are not eligible for tax deductions.

6.1.3 Therefore, the banks should either make full provision as per the guidelines or write-off such advances and claim such tax benefits as are applicable, by evolving appropriate methodology in consultation with their auditors/tax consultants. Recoveries made in such accounts should be offered for tax purposes as per the rules.

## 6.2 Write-off at Head Office Level

6.2.1 Banks may write-off advances at Head Office level, even though the relative advances are still outstanding in the branch books. However, it is necessary that provision is made as per the classification accorded to the respective accounts. In other words, if an advance is a loss asset, 100 percent provision will have to be made therefor.

6.2.2 Banks are custodians of public deposits and are therefore expected to make all efforts to protect the value of their assets. Banks are required to extinguish all available means of recovery before writing off any account fully or partly. It is observed that some banks are resorting to technical write off of accounts, which reduces incentives to recover. Banks resorting to partial and technical write-offs should not show the remaining part of the loan as standard asset. With a view to bring in more transparency, henceforth banks should disclose full details of write offs, including separate details about technical write offs, in their annual financial statements as per the format prescribed in the Annex III – 4(a) of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12158)  [on Financial Statements - Presentation and Disclosures dated August 30, 2021,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12158) as updated from time to time.

### 7. NPA Management – Requirement of Effective Mechanism and Granular Data

7.1 Asset quality of banks is one of the most important indicators of their financial health. Banks should, therefore put in place a robust MIS mechanism for early detection of signs of distress at individual account level as well as at segment level (asset class, industry, geographic, size, etc.). Such early warning signals should be used for putting in place an effective preventive asset quality management framework, including a transparent restructuring mechanism for viable accounts under distress within the prevailing regulatory framework, for preserving the economic value of those entities in all segments.

7.2 The banks' IT and MIS system should be robust and able to generate reliable and quality information with regard to their asset quality for effective decision making. There should be no inconsistencies between information furnished under regulatory / statutory reporting and the banks' own MIS reporting. Banks should also have system generated segment wise information on non-performing assets and restructured assets which may include data on the opening balances, additions, reductions (upgradations, actual recoveries, write-offs etc.), closing balances, provisions held, technical write-offs, etc.

# PART B1 - Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets

# 8. Early identification and reporting of stress

8.1 Lenders [4](#page-0-0) shall recognise incipient stress in loan accounts, immediately on default [5](#page-0-1) , by classifying such assets as special mention accounts (SMA) as per the following categories.


8.2 In the case of revolving credit facilities like cash credit/overdraft, the SMA sub-categories will be as follows:


8.3 The above-mentioned instructions on classification of borrower accounts into SMA categories are applicable for all loans (including retail loans), other than agricultural advances governed by crop season-based asset classification norms, irrespective of size of exposure of the bank.

8.4 Classification of borrower accounts as SMA as well as NPA shall be done as part of day-end process for the relevant date and the SMA or NPA classificatio
