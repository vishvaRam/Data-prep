Reserve Bank has been taking progressive measures to improve availability of digital infrastructure for banking services. In furtherance of this objective and as a part of efforts to accelerate and widen the reach of digital banking services, the concept of "Digital Banking Units" (DBUs) is being introduced by the Reserve Bank.
