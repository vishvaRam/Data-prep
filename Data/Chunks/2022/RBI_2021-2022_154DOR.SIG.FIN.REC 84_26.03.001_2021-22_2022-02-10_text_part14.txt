#### **Guidance Notes for Asset Reconstruction Companies**

The Bank has evolved Guidance Note, gist of which is given below. The words and expressions used in these notes shall have the same meaning as in the Act.

#### **(1) Acquisition of Financial Assets**

i) Every ARC is required to evolve Asset Acquisition Policy within 90 days of getting the certificate of registration which shall, inter alia, provide that the transactions will take place in a transparent manner and at a fair price in a wellinformed market, and the transactions are executed on arm's length basis by exercise of due diligence.

ii) The share of financial assets to be acquired from the bank / FI should be appropriately and objectively worked out keeping in view the provision in the Act requiring consent of secured creditors holding not less than 60% of the amount outstanding to a borrower for the purpose of enforcement of security interest;

iii) For easy and faster realisability, all the financial assets due from a single debtor to various banks/ FIs may be considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets having linkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure relatively faster and easy realisation.

iv) Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of assets for acquisition. Assets classified as SMA-2 in the books of the originator may also be acquired.

v) Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding commitments, if any, of any bank/ FI to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security interest in non-fund transactions, should provide for the relative commitments to continue with bank/ FI, till demand for funding arises.

vi) Loans not backed by proper documentation should be avoided.

vii) As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and should ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in scientific and objective manner. Valuation may be done internally or by engaging an independent agency, depending upon the value of the assets. Ideally, valuation may be entrusted to the committee authorised to approve acquisition of assets, which may carry out the task in line with an Asset Acquisition Policy laid down by the board of directors in this regard.

viii) The assets acquired by ARC should be transferred to the trusts set up by the ARC at the price at which these were acquired from the originator of the asset. However, there is no restriction on acquisition of assets from banks/ FIs directly in the books of trusts set up by ARC.

### (2) **Issuance of SRs**

i) Every ARC shall issue the SRs through the trust set up exclusively for the purpose. The trusteeship of such trust shall vest with the ARC.

ii) The trust shall issue SRs only to QBs and such SRs shall be transferable/ assignable only in favour of other QBs.

iii) Every ARC intending to issue SRs shall make disclosures in the offer document as prescribed by the Bank from time to time.

[46](#page-4-0)[(iv) Commonality and conflict of interest, if any, between the ARC and Rating Agency should be disclosed.
