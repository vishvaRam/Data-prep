equivalent of benefits of non-monetary nature (such as free furnished house, use of company car, etc.) may also be part of fixed pay.

# **2.3 Principles for Variable Pay**

**2.3.1 Composition of Variable Pay:** The variable pay may be in the form of sharelinked instruments, or a mix of cash and share-linked instruments. It shall be ensured that the share-linked instruments are in conformity with relevant statutory provisions.

**2.3.2 Proportion:** The proportion of variable pay in total compensation[4](#page-3-0) needs to be commensurate with the role and prudent risk taking profile of KMPs/ senior management. At higher levels of responsibility, the proportion of variable pay needs to be higher. There should be proper balance between the cash and share-linked instruments in the variable pay in case the variable pay contains share linked instruments. The variable pay should be truly and effectively variable and can be reduced to zero based on performance at an individual, business-unit and companywide level. In order to do so, performance measures and their relation to remuneration packages should be clearly defined at the beginning of the performance measurement period to ensure that the employees perceive the incentive mechanism.

**2.3.3 Deferral of variable pay:** Not all the variable pay awarded after performance assessment may be paid immediately. Certain portion of variable pay, as decided by the Board of the company, may be deferred to time horizon of the risks. The portion of deferral arrangement may be made applicable for both cash and non-cash components of the variable pay. Deferral period for such an arrangement may be decided by the Board of the company.

**2.3.4 Control and assurance function personnel:** KMPs and senior management engaged in financial control, risk management, compliance and internal audit may be compensated in a manner that is independent of the business areas they oversee and commensurate with their key role in the company. Accordingly, such personnel may have higher proportion of fixed compensation. However, a reasonable proportion of compensation may be in the form of variable pay, so that exercising the options of malus and/or clawback, when warranted, is not rendered infructuous.

# **3. Guaranteed bonus**

Guaranteed bonus may not be paid to KMPs and senior management. However, in the context of new hiring joining/sign-on bonus could be considered. Such bonus will neither be considered part of fixed pay nor of variable pay.

### **4. Malus / Clawback**

The deferred compensation may be subject to malus[5/](#page-4-0)clawback[6](#page-4-1) arrangements in the event of subdued or negative financial performance of the company and/or the relevant line of business or employee misconduct in any year. A representative set of situations may be identified by the NBFC, which require them to invoke the malus and clawback clauses that may be applicable on entire variable pay. While setting criteria for the application of malus and clawback, NBFCs may also specify a period during which malus and/or clawback can be applied, covering at least the deferral and retention periods[7](#page-4-2).
