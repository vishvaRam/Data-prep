th land holding of 5 acres and less.

(vi) An appropriate ceiling may be fixed on the interest, including processing and other charges that could be levied on such loans, which may be suitably publicised.

(vi) **Foreclosure Charges / Prepayment Penalty** - With effect from June 26, 2014 it has been decided that UCBs will not be permitted to charge foreclosure charges / prepayment penalties on all floating rate term loans sanctioned to individual borrowers.

#### **No Objection Certificate**

4.2 UCBs should not finance a borrower already availing credit facility from another bank without obtaining a 'No Objection Certificate' from the existing financing bank.

#### **4.3 Opening of Current Accounts**

4.3.1 Keeping in view the importance of credit discipline, at the time of opening of current accounts, banks should:

(i) insist on a declaration from the account holder to the effect that he is not enjoying any credit facility with any other commercial bank or obtain a declaration giving particulars of credit facilities enjoyed by him with any other commercial bank/s.

(ii) ascertain whether he / she is a member of any other co-operative society / bank; if so, the full details thereof such as name of the society / bank, number of shares held, details of credit facilities, such as nature, quantum, outstanding, due dates etc should be obtained.

4.3.2 Further, in case he / she is already enjoying any credit facility from any other commercial / cooperative bank, the bank opening a current account should duly inform the lending bank(s) concerned and also specifically insist on obtaining a "No Objection Certificate" from them. In case of a prospective customer who is a corporate or large borrower enjoying credit facilities from more than one bank, the banks may inform the consortium leader, if under consortium, and the banks concerned, if under multiple banking arrangement. In case a facility has been availed from a co-operative bank / society, it is essential for the bank to comply with the requirements of the Co-operative Societies Act / Rules of the state concerned in regard to membership and borrowings.

4.3.3 Banks may open current accounts of prospective customers in case no response is received from the existing bankers after a minimum waiting period of a fortnight. If a response is received within a fortnight, banks should assess the situation with reference to information provided on the prospective customer by the bank concerned and are not required to solicit a formal no objection, consistent with true freedom to the customer of banks as well as needed due diligence on the customer by the bank.

#### **Certification of Accounts of Non-Corporate Borrowers by Chartered Accountants**

4.4 As per the Income Tax Act, 1961, filing of audited balance sheet and Profit & Loss Account is mandatory for certain types of non-corporate entities. Therefore, the banks must insist on the audited financial statements from the borrowers enjoying large limits; since such borrowers would, in any case, be submitting audit certificate to the income-tax authorities, based on audit of their books of accounts by a Chartered Accountant.

# **Defaults in Payment of Statutory Dues by Borrowers**

4.5 UCBs may ensure that borrowers enjoying credit facilities, pay the provident fund payments and similar other statutory dues promptly. The non-payment of statutory dues by the borrowers is one of the symptoms of incipient sickness of an industrial unit. Therefore, it is in the interest of both the lender and borrower to give high priority to the clearance of these dues. Apart from insisting on the borrowers to indicate a definite programme for clearance of arrears, banks may consider suitable restrictions on the outflow of funds. UCBs may incorporate an appropriate declaration in their application forms for grant / renewal / enhancement of credit facilities so as to ensure that the position regarding the statutory dues is disclosed therein. In respect of the corporate borrowers and non-corporate borrowers, the amount of statutory dues should normally be reflected in their audited annual accounts. In case audited accounts do not indicate the position clearly, a certificate may be obtained from the Chartered Accountant for this purpose.

## **4.6 Sanction of Advances**

## **4.6.1 Irregularities / Deficiencies in Credit Sanction**

Banks should take suitable precautions to avoid irregular practices such as sanctioning of advances beyond discretionary powers and / or without proper credit appraisal in order to minimise chances of frauds.

### **4.6.2 Delegation of Powers**

(i) The Board of Directors should delegate specific powers to the Branch Managers and other functionaries at the Head Office level as also to the Chairman in the matter of sanction of advances and expenditure. A system should also be introduced to ensure that powers are exercised within the limits prescribed and any transgressions are immediately reported to Head Offic
