#### II. Debt instruments

- a. Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI) eligible for inclusion in Tier I capital
- b. Long Term Subordinated Bonds (LTSB) eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital

5. The guidelines governing the instruments specified in para 4 (I) &(II) above, indicating the regulatory requirements, are enclosed in [Annexes I](#page--1-0) & [II](#page--1-1) respectively.

6. For the purpose of enhancing investor education on the risk characteristics of regulatory capital requirements, RCBs, which issue regulatory capital instruments as specified in para 4 above, shall adhere to the following conditions:

a) For floating rate instruments, banks should not use their Fixed Deposit rate as benchmark.

b) A specific sign-off as quoted below, from the investors, for having understood the features and risks of the instruments, may be incorporated in the common application form of the proposed issue:

"By making this application, I / we acknowledge that I / we have understood the terms and conditions of the issue of [Name of the share/security] being issued by [Name of the bank] as disclosed in the Prospectus and Offer Document".

c) RCBs shall ensure that all the publicity material / offer document, application form and other communication with the investor should clearly state in bold letters (Arial font, size 14, equivalent size in English / Vernacular version) how a PNCPS / PCPS / RNCPS / RCPS / PDI / LTSB, as the case may be, is different from a fixed deposit, and that these instruments are not covered by deposit insurance.

d) The procedure for transfer to legal heirs in the event of death of the subscriber of the instrument should also be specified.

### **Refund of share capital**

7. In terms of Section 12 (2) (ii) read with Section 56 of the BR Act, a co-operative bank shall not withdraw or reduce its share capital, except to the extent and subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank may specify in this behalf. Accordingly, it has been decided to permit RCBs to refund the share capital to their members, or nominees / heirs of deceased members, on demand, subject to the following conditions:

a) The bank's capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) is 9 percent or above, both as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by NABARD during statutory inspection.

b) Such refund does not result in the CRAR of the bank falling below regulatory minimum of 9 per cent.

8. It is clarified that for the purpose of computing CRAR as above, accretion to capital funds after the balance sheet date[1,](#page-2-0) other than by way of profits, may be taken into account. Any reduction in capital funds, including by way of losses, during the aforesaid period shall also be considered.

# **Repeal**

9. The list of circulars, that stand repealed fully or partially, is furnished in [Appendix](#page--1-0) to the circular.

# **Effective Date**

10. These instructions shall come into force with immediate effect.

Yours faithfully,

(Usha Janakiraman) Chief
