y volatility. Hence, banks are required to estimate the riskiness of unhedged position of their borrowers as per the instructions contained in our [circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.85/21.06.200/2013-14 dated January 15, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8694&Mode=0) as well as our [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8914&Mode=0)  [DBOD.No.BP.BC.116/21.06.200/2013-14 dated June 3, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8914&Mode=0) and make incremental provisions on their exposures to such entities:

# 5.6 Prudential norms on creation and utilisation of floating provisions

# 5.6.1 Principle for creation of floating provisions by banks

The bank's board of directors should lay down approved policy regarding the level to which the floating provisions can be created. The bank should hold floating provisions for 'advances' and 'investments' separately and the guidelines prescribed will be applicable to floating provisions held for both 'advances' & 'investment portfolios.

#### 5.6.2 Principle for utilisation of floating provisions by banks

5.6.2.1 The floating provisions should not be used for making specific provisions as per the extant prudential guidelines in respect of non-performing assets or for making regulatory provisions for standard assets. The floating provisions can be used only for contingencies under extraordinary circumstances for making specific provisions in impaired accounts after obtaining board's approval and with prior permission of RBI. The Boards of the banks should lay down an approved policy as to what circumstances would be considered extraordinary.

5.6.2.2 To facilitate banks' Boards to evolve suitable policies in this regard, it is clarified that the extra-ordinary circumstances refer to losses which do not arise in the normal course of business and are exceptional and non-recurring in nature. These extra-ordinary circumstances could broadly fall under three categories viz. General, Market and Credit. Under general category, there can be situations where bank is put unexpectedly to loss due to events such as civil unrest or collapse of currency in a country. Natural calamities and pandemics may also be included in the general category. Market category would include events such as a general melt down in the markets, which affects the entire financial system. Among the credit category, only exceptional credit losses would be considered as an extraordinary circumstance.

5.6.2.3 In order to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID 19 related stress on banks, as a measure to enable capital conservation, banks are allowed to utilise 100 per cent of floating provisions held by them as on December 31, 2020 for making specific provisions for nonperforming assets with prior approval of their Boards. Such utilisation is permitted up to March 31, 2022.

#### 5.6.3 Accounting

Floating provisions cannot be reversed by credit to the profit and loss account. They can only be utilised for making specific provisions in extraordinary circumstances as mentioned above. Until such utilisation, these provisions can be netted off from gross NPAs to arrive at disclosure of net NPAs. Alternatively, they can be treated as part of Tier II capital within the overall ceiling of 1.25% of total risk weighted assets.

#### 5.6.4 Disclosures

Banks should make comprehensive disclosures on floating provisions in the "notes on accounts" to the balance sheet on (a) opening balance in the floating provisions account, (b) the quantum of floating provisions made in the accounting year, (c) purpose and amount of draw down made during the accounting year, and (d) closing balance in the floating provisions account.

### 5.7 Additional Provisions at higher than prescribed rates

# 5.7.1 For NPAs

The regulatory norms for provisioning represent the minimum requirement. A bank may voluntarily make specific provisions for advances at rates which are higher than the rates prescribed under existing regulations, to provide for estimated actual loss in collectible amount, provided such higher rates are approved by the Board of Directors and consistently adopted from year to year. Such additional provisions are not to be considered as floating provisions. The additional provisions for NPAs, like the minimum regulatory provision on NPAs, may be netted off from gross NPAs to arrive at the net NPAs

# 5.7.2 For standard assets

The provisioning rates prescribed in this Master Circular are the regulatory minimum and banks are encouraged to make provisions at higher rates in respect of advances to stressed sectors of the economy. In this regard, it is advised as under:

- (i) Banks shall put in place a Boardâ€“approved policy for making provisions for standard assets at rates higher than the regulatory minimum, based on evaluation of
