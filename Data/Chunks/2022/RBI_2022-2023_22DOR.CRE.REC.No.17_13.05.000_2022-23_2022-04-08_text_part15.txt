s will have a set of standing instructions spelling out the action that the branches will have to initiate in the calamity affected areas immediately after the requisite declaration by the district / State authorities. It is necessary that these instructions should also be available with the State Government authorities and all the District Collectors so that all concerned are clear as to the action that would be taken by the banks' branches in the affected areas.

3. The precise details in regard to the provision of credit assistance by the commercial banks, will depend on the requirements of the situation, their own operational capabilities and the actual needs of the borrowers. This can be decided by them in consultation with the district authorities.

4. Nevertheless, to enable banks to take uniform and concerted action expeditiously, particularly to provide the financial assistance to agriculturist, small scale industrial units, artisan, small business and trading establishments affected by natural calamities, the following guidelines are commended.

5. To facilitate co-ordination and expeditious action by the financing institutions, the convenors of the concerned District Consultative Committee (DCC) of the affected districts should convene a meeting immediately after the occurrence of natural calamities. In the event of the calamity covering a larger part of the State, the convenors of the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) will also convene a meeting immediately to evolve a co-ordinated programme of action for implementation of the programme in collaboration with the State / district authorities while determining the quantum of assistance required by a person affected by the natural calamity, the banks may take into consideration the assistance / subsidy received by him from the State Government and / or other agencies.

6. Regional / Zonal heads of UCBs should be vested with certain discretionary powers so that they do not have to seek fresh approvals from their Central Offices to the line of action agreed to by the District / State Level Bankers' Committees. For example, such discretionary power would be necessary in respect of adoption of scale of finance, extension of loan periods, sanction of new loans, keeping in view the total liability of the borrower (i.e. arising out of the old loan where the assets financed are damaged or lost on account of natural calamity as well as the new loan for creation / repair of such assets, margin, security, etc.).

# **7. Identification of the Beneficiaries**

The bank branches should obtain from the concerned Government authorities list of affected villages within their area of operation. From among the identified persons, assessment of loss sustained by the existing constituents of the banks would be easier. In the case of fresh borrowers, however, discreet enquiries should be made in this regard and assistance of the Government. authorities should be sought wherever available for ascertaining genuineness of their requirements. For providing conversion facilities in respect of crop loans, procedure for identification of areas where such facilities have to be provided has been indicated under crop loans in paragraph 12 below.

# **8. Coverage**

Each branch will provide credit assistance not only to its existing borrowers but also to other eligible persons within its command area provided they are not covered by any other financial agency.

# **9. Priorities**

Immediate assistance including finances would be needed for protecting and rejuvenating standing crops / orchards / plantations etc. Equally important will be repair and protection of livestock sheds, grains and fodder storage / structures, drainage, pumping, and other measures and operations to repair pump-sets, motors, engines and other necessary implements. Subject to seasonal requirements, next crop financing would be taken up.

### **10. Agricultural Loans**

i) The bank assistance in relation to agriculture would be needed in the form of short-term loans for the purpose of raising crops and term loans for purchase of milch / draught animals, repairs of existing tubewells and pump-sets, digging of new tube-wells and installation of new pump-sets, land reclamation, silt / sand removal, protection and rejuvenation of standing crops / orchard / plantations, etc., repairs and protection of livestock sheds, grain and fodder storage structures, etc.

ii) Crop Loans: In the case of natural calamities, such as droughts, floods etc., Government authorities would have declared annewari to indicate the extent to which the crops are damaged. However, where such declaration has not been made banks should not delay in providing conversion facilities, and the District Collector's certificate that crop yield is below 50 percent of the normal yield supported by the views of the DCC in the matter (for which a special meeting may have to be convened) should be sufficient for invoking quick relief arrangements.
