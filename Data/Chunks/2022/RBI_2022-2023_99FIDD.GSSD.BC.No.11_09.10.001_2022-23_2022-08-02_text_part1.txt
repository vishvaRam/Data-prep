## **Master Circular**

## **1. Credit Facilities to Minority Communities:**

- 1.1 In order to ensure that minority communities secure, in a fair and adequate measure, the benefits flowing from various Government sponsored schemes, Scheduled Commercial Banks (referred to as 'banks' hereafter) are advised to ensure smooth flow of bank credit to minority communities.
- 1.2 Government of India has forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts having at least 25% minority population [\(Annexure I\)](#page--1-1), excluding those States/UTs where minorities are in majority (Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). Accordingly, banks are advised to specially monitor the credit flow to minorities in these 121 districts thereby, ensuring that the minority communities receive a fair and equitable portion of the credit within the overall target of the priority sector
- 1.3 In terms of Reserve Bank's [Master Direction on Priority Sector](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) Lending (PSL) dated [September 04, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) (as updated from time to time), a target of 40 percent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic scheduled commercial banks and foreign banks; for Small Finance Banks the target is 75% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC). Within this, a sub-target of 11.5 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for FY: 2022-23 for lending to weaker sections which includes, among others, persons from minority communities.

## **2**. **Definition of Minority Communities**

- 2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the Government of India, Ministry of Minority Affairs:
	- (a) Sikhs
	- (b) Muslims
	- (c) Christians
	- (d) Zoroastrians
	- (e) Buddhists
	- (f) Jains

2.2 In the case of a partnership firm, if the majority of the partners belong to one or the other of the specified minority communities, advances granted to such partnership firms may be treated as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the majority beneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority community, then such lending can be classified as advances to the specified communities. A company is a separate legal entity and hence advances granted to it cannot be classified as advances to the specified minority communities.

### **3. Creation of Special Cell and designating an exclusive Officer**

- 3.1 Each bank should set up a special cell having a Nodal Officer holding the rank of Deputy General Manager/Assistant General Manager or any other similar rank, in order to ensure smooth flow of credit to minority communities.
- 3.2 The Lead Bank in each of the minority concentration districts should have an officer who shall exclusively look after the problems regarding the credit flow to minority communities. It shall be his/her responsibility to publicise among the minority communities various programmes of bank credit
