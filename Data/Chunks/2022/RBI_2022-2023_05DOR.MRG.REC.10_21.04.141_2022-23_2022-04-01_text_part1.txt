## **MASTER CIRCULAR ON INVESTMENTS BY PRIMARY (URBAN) CO-OPERATIVE BANKS**

# **1. RESTRICTIONS ON HOLDING SHARES IN OTHER CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES**

1.1 Section 19 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) (BR Act, 1949 (AACS)) stipulates that no co-operative bank shall hold shares in any other co-operative society except to such extent and subject to such conditions as the Reserve Bank of India (Reserve Bank) may specify in that behalf. However, nothing contained in the section applies to -

- 1.1.1 shares acquired through funds provided by the State Government for that purpose;
- 1.1.2 in the case of a central co-operative bank, the holding of shares in the state co-operative bank to which it is affiliated; and
- 1.1.3 in the case of a primary (urban) co-operative bank (UCB), holding of shares in the central co-operative bank to which it is affiliated or in the state co-operative bank of the state in which it is registered.

1.2 In pursuance of the powers conferred by Section 19 read with Section 56 of the said Act, the Reserve Bank has specified that the extent and conditions subject to which co-operative banks may hold shares in any other co-operative society shall be as follows:

- 1.2.1 The total investments of a co-operative bank in the shares of cooperative institutions, other than those falling under any of the categories stated at paragraphs 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 above, shall not exceed 2 per cent of its owned funds (paid-up share capital and reserves).
- 1.2.2 The investment of a bank in the shares of any one co-operative institution coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above shall not exceed 5 per cent of the subscribed capital of that institution.

**Note:** When more than one co-operative bank contributes to the shares in a cooperative society falling under paragraph 1.2.1, the limit of 5 per cent of the subscribed capital indicated above shall apply not in respect of the investment of each of the banks but in respect of the investment of all the banks taken together. In other words, the total investment of all the co-operative banks should be limited to 5 per cent of the subscribed capital of the enterprise concerned.

A co-operative bank should offer to make its contribution to the shares of a cooperative society coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above only if the bye-laws of the recipient society provide for the retirement of share capital contributed by it.

- 1.2.3 The retirement of the share capital contributed by a bank to the shares of any society coming under paragraph 1.2.1 above should be completed in 10 equal annual installments commencing from the cooperative year immediately following the year in which the concern commences business or production.
- 1.2.4 A co-operative bank should not, except with the permission of the Reserve Bank, contribute to the share capital of a society coming under category referred to in paragraph 1.2.1 above, if it is situated outside its area of operation.
- 1.2.5 The above restrictions will not apply to holdings by co-operative banks of shares in non-profit making co-operative societies such as those formed for the protection of mutual interests, (e.g., co-operative banks' association) or for the promotion of co-operative education etc., (e.g., state co-operative union), or housing co-operatives for the purpose of acquiring premises on ownership basis, etc.

## **2 STATUTORY (SLR) INVESTMENTS**

## **2.1 Maintenance of Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) for UCBs**

Banks shall refer to the [Master Direction-Reserve Bank of India \[Cash Reserve Ratio](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12131) [\(CRR\) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio \(SLR\)\] Directions, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12131) on the maintenance of SLR.

## **3 INVESTMENT POLICY**

3.1 Keeping in view the various regulatory/statutory guidelines and the bank's own internal requirements, UCBs should lay down, with the approval of their Board of Directors, the broad Investment Policy and objectives to be achieved while undertaking investment transactions. The Investment Policy should be reviewed each year. The Board/Committee/Top Management should actively oversee investment transactions. Bank
