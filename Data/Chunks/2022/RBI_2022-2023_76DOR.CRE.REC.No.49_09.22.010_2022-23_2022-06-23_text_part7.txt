ng real estate activity.

For instance, a company has two divisions. One division is engaged in real estate activity, and other division is engaged in power production. An infrastructure loan, for setting up of a power plant extended to such a company, to be repaid by the sale of electricity would not be classified as CRE. The exposure may or may not be secured by plant and machinery.

3. Loans extended against the Security of future rent receivables

A few banks have formulated schemes where the owners of existing real estate such as shopping malls, office premises, etc. have been offered finance to be repaid out of the rentals generated by these properties. Even though such exposures do not result in funding / acquisition of commercial real estate, the repayment might be sensitive to fall in real estate rentals and such exposures should be classified as CRE. However, if there are certain in built safety conditions which have the effect of delinking the repayments from real estate price volatility like, the lease rental agreement between the lessor and lessee has a lock in period which is not shorter than the tenor of loan and there is no clause which allows a downward revision in the rentals during the period covered by the loan banks can classify such exposures as non CRE. Banks may, however, record a reasoned note in all such cases.

4. Credit facilities provided to construction companies which work as Contractors

The working capital facilities extended to construction companies working as contractors, rather than builders, will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment would depend upon the contractual payments received in accordance with the progress in completion of work.

5. Financing of acquisition / renovation of self-owned office / company premises

Such exposures will not be treated as CRE exposures because the repayment will come from company revenues. The exposures to industrial units towards setting up of units or projects and working capital requirement, etc. would not be treated as CRE Exposures.
