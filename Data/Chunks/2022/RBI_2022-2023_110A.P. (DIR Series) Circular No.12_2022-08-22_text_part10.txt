## **26. Designated banks**

(1) An eligible person resident in India making ODI (or financial commitment) in a foreign entity is required to route all its transactions relating to such investment (or financial commitment) through the AD bank designated by it. In case a foreign entity is being set up by two or more persons resident in India, then all such persons shall route all transactions in respect of that foreign entity only through one designated AD bank. However, different AD banks may be designated, if required, for different foreign entities.
