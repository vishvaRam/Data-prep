#### **'Voluntary Retention Route' (VRR) for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) investment**

#### **Introduction**

The Reserve Bank, in consultation with the Government of India and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), introduces a separate channel, called the 'Voluntary Retention Route' (VRR), to enable FPIs to invest in debt markets in India. Broadly, investments through the Route will be free of the macro-prudential and other regulatory norms applicable to FPI investments in debt markets, provided FPIs voluntarily commit to retain a required minimum percentage of their investments in India for a period.

- iii. 'Minor violations' shall mean violations that are, in the considered opinion of the custodians, unintentional, temporary in nature or have occurred on account of reasons beyond the control of FPIs, and in all cases are corrected on detection.
- iv. 'Related FPIs' shall mean 'investor group' as defined in Regulation 23(3) of SEBI (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014.
- v. 'Repo' shall have the
