The Chairman/ Managing Director/ Chief Executive Officers All Banks

Dear Sir/Madam

# **Note Sorting Machines - Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters**

Please refer to our circular [DCM\(R&D\)No.G-26/18.00.14/2009-10](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5671&Mode=0) dated May 11, 2010 setting out ''Note Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters'' for the Note Sorting Machines installed in the banks.

2. In the backdrop of introduction of the new series banknotes, these parameters have been reviewed and a revised set of guidelines are [enclosed](#page--1-0) for implementation.

3. The guidelines shall be implemented with immediate effect.

Yours faithfully

(Sanjeev Prakash) Chief General Manager

Encl : As above.

### **Guidelines on Note Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters**

### **1. Introduction**

A fit note is a note that is genuine, sufficiently clean to allow its denomination to be readily ascertained and thus suitable for recycling. An unfit note is a note that is not suitable for recycling because of its physical condition or belongs to a series that has been phased out by Reserve Bank of India. All the fitness parameters laid down in this document are to be evaluated individually. A note must pass all the fitness parameters to be considered fit for recycling.

These parameters provide the minimum standards for cash handling machines used by banks (hereinafter called 'the machines'). Notes can only be recycled / reissued if they are evaluated as genuine and fit according to these parameters. Authenticity check is a prerequisite for fitness sorting. Fitness sorting can be done only in case of genuine notes. The machines shall be able to identify and segregrate suspected counterfeits and notes which are unfit for circulation in terms of these standards in a reliable and consistent manner.

The Reserve Bank of India phases out certain series of notes from circulation from time to time. These notes, though considered legal tender unless otherwise specified, are unfit for reissue. As and when the Reserve Bank of India decides to phase out a specific series of a specific denomination of notes, the machines shall sort all the phased out notes as unfit, irrespective of their physical condition.

#### **2. Applicability**

These parameters are applicable to machines operated by banks, either directly by their staff or indirectly by their agents. These machines can be of any of the following:

- i. machines which check the authenticity and fitness of notes, i.e. note processing machines / note sorting machines, and
- ii. machines which check only the authenticity of notes, i.e. note authentication machines and classify the individual notes as either genuine or suspect.

## **3. Authenticity Check**

The machines shall perform authenticity check with reference to the features of genuine notes as disclosed by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time on its website. Any note which is not found to be having all the features of a genuine note shall be classified by the machine as suspect/ reject.

#### **4. Fitness Sorting**

As a part of fitness sorting, notes with any visual or physical defects are to be sorted as unfit as per the criteria set out in **[Table 1.](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=5671&fn=2753&Mode=0#T1)**


### **(i) Soiling**

Soiling refers to the general distribution of dirt across the entire note or in some patterns. It is a measure of the loss of reflectivity from the unprinted areas due to dirt, ageing (yellowing), wear and extraneous markings and includes decolouration due to ageing, excessive folding and other wearing. Soiling increases the optical density and decreases the reflectance of the notes. Notes exceeding the soiling levels set out in **[Table 2](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=5671&fn=2753&Mode=0#T2)** shall be sorted as unfit. Both the obverse and the reverse of the note shall be checked for soiling.


#### **(ii) Limpness**

Limpness relates to structural deterioration or wear resulting in a marked lack of stiffness in the note paper. Notes with very low stiffness of paper, i.e. with paper which is worn out in circulation or mechanically mutilated shall be sorted as unfit. Detectors for paper quality shall be adapted to the same level as for soiling.

### **(iii) Dog-Ears**

Banknotes with dog-ears with an area of more than 100 mmÂ² and a minimum length of the smaller edge greater than 5 mm shall be sorted as unfit. Chipped notes shall also be sorted as unfit.

### **(iv) Tears**

Notes exhibiting at least one tear at the edge shall be classified as those having tears Notes with tears larger than those indicated in **[Table 3](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=5671&fn=2753&Mode=0#T3)** shall be sorted as unfit.
