## **Auction process for allocation of investment amount under VRR**

The auction process for allotment of investment amounts under VRR shall be as under:

- a. An FPI shall bid two variables the amount it proposes to invest and the retention period of that investment, which shall not be less than the minimum retention period applicable for that auction.
- b. FPIs are permitted to place multiple bids.
- c. The criterion for allocation under each auction shall be the retention period bid in the auction.
- d. Bids will be accepted in descending order of retention period, the highest first, until the amounts of accepted bids add up to the auction amount.
- e. Allotment at margin (i.e., at the lowest retention period accepted), in case the amount bid at margin is more than the amount available for allotment, shall be as below:
	- i. The marginal bid shall be allocated partially such that the total acceptance amount matches the auction amount.
	- ii. In case there are more than one marginal bids, allocation shall be made to the bid with the largest amount, and then in descending order of amount bid until the acceptance amount matches the auction amount.
	- iii. In case the amount offered is the same for two or more marginal bids, the amount will be allocated equally.
- f. If an FPI has been allotted multiple bids in an auction, the CPS shall be reckoned for each bid separately.
- g. FPI which has got CPS allocated under an auction will be eligible to participate in subsequent auction as well.
