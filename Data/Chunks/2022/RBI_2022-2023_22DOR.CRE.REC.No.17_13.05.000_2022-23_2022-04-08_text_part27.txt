<span id="page-4-1"></span><span id="page-4-0"></span><sup>5</sup> The bank to pull out information from Central KYC registry as and when that is set up <sup>6</sup> Not applicable, if the group loan is upto Rs. 1,00,000/-.


<span id="page-0-0"></span><sup>7</sup> Until the data base of individual SHG members is accumulated in the CICs, this information may be collected and relied upon based on a letter provided by the SHG concerned. 17.2 will not be applicable if the SHG account is regular


<span id="page-1-0"></span><sup>8</sup> All SHGs must decide upfront how they propose to utilize the SHG loan. The actual distribution of the loan to individual members wherever it was agreed to be above Rs. 30,000 or where the actual amount disbursed exceeded Rs.30000 thoughnot agreed at the time of taking loan from the bank, must be reported to the bank by the SHG office bearers. Non-adherence to this condition may be taken into account while extending further loan to the SHG or renewing its cash credit limit next time. The banks need to incorporate suitable clauses in the loan agreements relating to penal provisions for providing wrong information regarding the amount of loans taken out of the group loans. Depending upon their experience, banks may also insist on maintenance of verifiable record of the amounts distributed out of bank loans in cases where the average amount of loan availed by the SHG per member exceeds Rs.20,000/-.
