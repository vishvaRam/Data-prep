2. Investment by UCBs in the equity shares of the UO, for acquiring its membership, shall be exempt from the limits for investments in Non- SLR / unlisted securities prescribed in paragraph 12.1.2 (a) and 12.1.2 (b) above.

#### **12.1.3 Restrictions**

- (a) Investment in perpetual debt instruments is not permitted.
- (b) In terms of [UBD.\(PCB\).BPD.Cir.No.14/16.20.000/2007-08 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3817&Mode=0)  [September 18, 2007,](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3817&Mode=0) where banks have already exceeded the limit for investment in unlisted securities, no further investment in such securities will be permitted. Since there is a time lag between issuance and listing of securities, which are proposed to be listed but not listed at the time of subscription, banks may not be able to participate in primary issues of non-SLR securities. In view of this, investments in non-SLR debt securities (both primary and secondary market) by banks where the security is proposed to be listed in the Exchange(s) may be considered as investment in listed security at the time of making investment. However, if such security is not listed within the period specified, the same will be reckoned for the 10 per cent limit specified for unlisted non-SLR securities. In case such investments included under unlisted non-SLR securities lead to a breach of 10 per cent limit, the bank would not be allowed to make further investments in non-SLR securities (both primary and secondary market) till such time its investment in unlisted securities comes within the limit of 10 per cent.
- (c) Investment in deep discount / zero coupon bonds should be subject to the minimum rating as stated above and comparable market yields for the residual duration. However, banks are not permitted to invest in Zero Coupon Bonds from February 18, 2011 as advised vide [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6268&Mode=0)  [No.UCB\(PCB\)BPD.Cir.No.36/16.20.000/2010-11 dated February 18, 2011](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6268&Mode=0) unless the issuer builds up a sinking fund for all accrued interest and keeps it invested in liqu
