# **9. National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation (NMDFC)**

NMDFC promotes economic and developmental activities for the backward sections amongst the minorities. NMDFC works as an apex body and channelises its funds to the beneficiaries through the State Minority Finance Corporation of each State/Union Territory. Banks may implement the schemes evolved by NMDFC. While extending finance, banks should bear in mind the guidelines/instructions issued from time to time on priority sector advances.

# **10. Prime Minister's New 15 Point Programme for the Welfare of Minorities**

An important objective of the above Programme is to ensure that an appropriate percentage of the priority sector lending is targeted for the minority communities and that the benefits of various government sponsored schemes reach the underprivileged, which includes the disadvantaged sections of the minority communities. The New Programme is to be implemented by the Central Ministries/Departments concerned through State Governments/Union Territories and envisages location of certain proportion of development projects in minority concentration districts. Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are required to ensure that within the overall target for priority sector lending and the sub-target of 11.5 per cent for the weaker sections for FY: 2022-23, sufficient care is taken to ensure that minority communities also receive an equitable portion of the credit. Lead Banks have been advised to keep this requirement in view while preparing District Credit Plans.
