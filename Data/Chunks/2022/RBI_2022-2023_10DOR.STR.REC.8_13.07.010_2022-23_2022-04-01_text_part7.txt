no violation of FEMA regulations takes place and banks are not exposed to various risks the export advances received by the exporters are in compliance with the regulations/ directions issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.

- 2.3.3.2 Further, banks should also ensure that the export advances received by the exporters are in compliance with the regulations/ directions issued under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.
- 2.3.3.3 It is reiterated that export performance guarantees, where permitted to be issued, shall strictly be in the nature of performance guarantee and shall not contain any clauses which may in effect allow such performance guarantees to be utilized as financial guarantees/Standby Letters of Credits

### **2.3.4 Review of banks' procedures**

Banks may periodically review the position regarding delegation of powers and their procedures, and take such action as may be necessary with a view to expediting decision on export proposals. They may also consider designating a specified branch, equipped with adequately qualified and trained staff, in each important centre to deal expeditiously with all export credit proposals at the centre.

# **2.3.5 Overseas Investment – Guarantee on behalf of Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WOSs)/Joint Ventures (JVs) abroad**

An Indian party may have financial commitment to its overseas JV / WOS to the limit, as prescribed by the Reserve bank from time to time, of the net worth of the Indian party as on the date of the last audited balance sheet. The financial commitment may be in the form of

- (i) capital contribution and loan to the JV / WOS;
- (ii) corporate guarantee (only 50 percent value in case of performance guarantee) and / or bank guarantee (which is backed by a counter guarantee / collateral by the Indian party) on behalf of the JV / WOS and
- (iii) charge on immovable / movable property and other financial assets of the Indian party (including group company) on behalf of JV / WOS.

The above measures were intended to assist Indian companies in their overseas business. However, it has been observed that banks are extending non-fund based credit facilities like guarantees / stand-by letter of credits / letter of comforts etc. on behalf of Joint Ventures (JV)/ Wholly Owned Subsidiaries (WoS) / Wholly Owned Step Down Subsidiaries (WoSDS) for purposes which are not connected with their business, rather, in certain cases, these facilities are used to avail foreign currency loans for repayment of Rupee loans.

Further while extending fund / non-fund based credit facilities to overseas JV / WOS / WoSDS of Indian companies in connection with their business, either through branches in India or through branches / subsidiaries abroad, banks should ensure effective monitoring of the end use of such facilities and its conformity with the business needs of such entities. Banks may also ensure compliance with [A.P. \(DIR Series\) Circular No. 20 dated March 13, 2018](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11227&Mode=0) regarding 'Discontinuance of Letters of Undertaking (LoUs) and Letters of Comfort (LoCs) for Trade Credits'.

## **2.4 Restrictions on guarantees for placement of funds with NBFCs or other non-bank entities**

- **2.4.1** Banks should not execute guarantees for enabling placement of funds with NBFCs or other non-banking entities directly or indirectly, including inter-company deposits/ loans. This stipulation will apply to all sources of funds raised by such entities, e.g. deposits/ loans received from trusts and other institutions.
