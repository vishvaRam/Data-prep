 them promptly on their invocation as reluctance on their part to honour commitments in respect of invoked guarantees tend to bring the banking system into disrepute.

### 1.5 **Delay in Obtaining Certified Copies of Judgments**

(i) The Ministry of Finance has advised that some of the Departments such as Department of Revenue, Govt. of India, are finding it difficult to execute judgments delivered by various courts in their favour as banks do not honour their guarantees unless certified copies of the court judgments are made available to them.

(ii) Keeping in view these difficulties, banks may follow the following procedure:

(a) Where the bank is a party to the proceeding initiated by Government for enforcement of bank guarantee and the case is decided in favour of the Government by the Court, bank should not insist on

production of certified copy of the judgment as the judgment order is pronounced in open court in the presence of the parties / their counsels and the judgment is known to the bank and a copy of the judgement is available on websites of the Courts.

(b) In case the bank is not a party to the proceeding, a signed copy of the minutes of the order certified by the Registrar / Deputy or Assistant Registrar of the High Court duly attested to be true copy by Govt. Counsel should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under the guarantees unless the guarantor bank decides to file any appeal against the order of the High Court.

## 1.6 **Correspondence with Government Departments**

(i) The Constitution of India states that all executive action relating to Union of India shall be, and shall be stated to be, in the name of President of India. However, the business of the Government of India is transacted through several ministries / departments and even though documents such as guarantees reflect the President of India as one of the parties, correspondence is not to be exchanged with the President of India but with concerned Government Ministry / Departments.

(ii) The banks should, therefore, ensure that any correspondence relating to guarantees furnished by the banks in the name of the President of India favouring the Government Departments should not be addressed to the President of India causing avoidable inconvenience to the President's Secretariat.

# **2. Co-acceptance of Bills**

# 2.1 **Irregularities in Co-acceptance of Bills**

(i) Banks have been co-accepting bills of their customers. On many occasions these bills turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of sister concerns on each other where no genuine trade transaction takes place. Such bills on maturity are not honoured by the drawees and the banks which have co-accepted the bills have to make payment of these bills and thereafter, they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers / drawees of bills. This happens because the financial position and capacity of the parties to honour the bills, in the event of need, is not gone into by the banks co-accepting the bills.

(ii) There have also been cases where the particulars regarding coacceptance of bills are not recorded in the bank's books with the result that the extent of co-acceptance cannot be verified during inspections and the Head Office becomes aware of the co-acceptance only when a claim is received from the discounting bank.

### 2.2 **Safeguards**

In view of the above, banks should keep in view the following safeguards:

(i) While sanctioning co-acceptance limits to their customers, the need therefore should be ascertained and such limits should be extended only to their customers enjoying other limits with the bank.

(ii) Only genuine trade bills should be co-accepted and the banks should ensure that the goods covered by bills co-accepted are actually received in the stock accounts of the borrowers.

(iii) The valuation of the goods as mentioned in the accompanying invoice should also be verified to see that there is no over valuation of stocks.

(iv) The banks should not extend their co-acceptance to house bills / accommodation bills drawn by group concerns on one another.

(v) The powers to co-accept bills, beyond a stipulated limit, must be exercised by two authorised officials jointly.

(vi) Proper records of the bills co-accepted for each customer should be maintained so that the commitments for each customer and the total commitments at a branch can be readily ascertained and these should be scrutinised by internal inspectors and commented upon in their reports.

(vii) Proper periodical returns may be prescribed so that the Branch Managers report such co-acceptance commitments entered into by them to the controlling offices. Such returns should also reveal the position of bills that have become overdue and which the bank had to meet under the coacceptance obligation. This will enable the controlling offices to monitor such co-acceptances furnished by the branches and take suitable action in time, in difficult cases.
