etter capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should revisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure speedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.

iv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter-departmental/governmental coordination in the financial sector, should, therefore, be leveraged to further the objective of doubling farmers' income by 2022. Lead Banks are accordingly advised to ensure the following:

- a. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in consideration
- b. Include 'Doubling of Farmers' Income by 2022' as a regular agenda under the Lead Bank Scheme in various fora such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC
- c. For the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead Banks may use the benchmarks as may be provided by NABARD
- d. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agriculture/agroancillary lending plan of the bank.

## **10. Expanding and Deepening of Digital Payments Ecosystem**

With a view to expanding and deepening the digital payments ecosystem, the SLBCs/UTLBCs were advised to identify one district in their respective States/UTs on a pilot basis in consultation with banks and stakeholders and allocate it to a bank with significant footprint which will endeavour to make the district 100% digitally enabled within one year, in order to enable every individual in the district to make/ receive payments digitally in a safe, secure, quick, affordable and convenient manner. SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were also advised to devise a time bound roadmap to all branches of member banks (Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks, Regional Rural Banks, Small Finance Banks and Payments Banks) located in the identified district(s) for on-boarding merchants/ traders/ businesses/ utility service providers to facilitate fully digital transactions. Further, SLBC/ UTLBC Convenor Banks were advised to constitute a Sub-Committee on Digital Payments at SLBC/ UTLBC level. Subsequently, SLBCs/ UTLBCs were also advised to scale up the captioned programme in one or two other districts under their jurisdiction in consultation with State Governments/ UT Administrations and other stakeholders.
