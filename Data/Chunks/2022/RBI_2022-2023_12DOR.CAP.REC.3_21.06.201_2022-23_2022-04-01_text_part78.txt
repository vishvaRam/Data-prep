 Template**

14.12.1 The common template which banks should use is set out in **Table DF-11** of [Annex 18,](#page--1-0) along with explanations.

<sup>106</sup> [Master Circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.73/21.06.001/2009-10 dated Feb 8, 2010.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=5494)

14.12.2 It may be noted that banks should not add or delete any rows / columns from the common reporting template. This is essential to ensure that there is no divergence in reporting templates across banks and across jurisdictions which could undermine the objectives of consistency and comparability of a bank's regulatory capital. The template will retain the same row numbering used in its first column such that market participants can easily map the Indian version of templates to the common version designed by the Basel Committee.

14.12.3 The Basel Committee has suggested that in cases where the national implementation of Basel III rules<sup>107</sup> applies a more conservative definition of an element (e.g., components and criteria of regulatory capital, regulatory adjustments etc.), national authorities may choose between one of two approaches listed below for the purpose of disclosure:

*Approach 1:* In the national version of the template, banks are required to maintain the same definitions<sup>108</sup> of all rows. Further, banks will have to report the impact of the more conservative national definition in the rows exclusively designated for national specific adjustments.

*Approach 2:* In the national version of the template, banks are required to use the definitions of elements as implemented in that jurisdiction<sup>109</sup>, clearly labelling them as being different from the Basel III minimum definition<sup>110</sup>, and banks are required to separately disclose the impact of each of these different definitions in the notes to the template.

14.12.4 The aim of both the approaches is to provide all the information necessary to enable market participants to calculate the capital of banks on a common basis. In the Indian context, Approach 2 appears to be more practical and less burdensome for banks than the Approach 1. Under the Approach 2, banks have to furnish data based on the definition of capital / regulatory adjustments as implemented in India. The difference with the Basel III minimum can be separately disclosed and explained in notes to the templates. This way of disclosure will be more relevant and comprehensible to a larger number of users of disclosures more specifically, the domestic users. At the same time, information provided in the notes to the templates to indicate differences from Basel III minimum will help facilitate cross-jurisdictional comparison of banks' capital, should users desire. Accordingly, the disclosure templates have been customised, keeping in view the consistency and comparability of disclosures.

#### **14.13 Reconciliation Requirements**

14.13.1 Banks will be required to disclose a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital elements back to the balance sheet in the audited (or unaudited) financial statements. This requirement aims to address disconnect, if any, present in a bank's disclosure between the numbers used for the calculation of regulatory capital and the numbers used in the balance sheet.

14.13.2 Banks will have to follow a three step approach to show the link between their balance sheet and the numbers which are used in the composition of capital disclosure template set out in **[Annex 18](#page--1-0) (Table DF-11** whichever applicable). The three steps are explained below and also illustrated in Table DF-12 of [Annex 18:](#page--1-0)

Step 1: banks are required to disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation<sup>111</sup> (**Table DF-12 of [Annex 18](#page--1-0)**);

Step 2: banks will have to expand the lines of the balance sheet under regulatory scope of consolidation (**Table DF-12 of [Annex 18](#page--1-0)**) to display all components which are used in the composition of capital disclosure template (**Table DF-11 of [Annex 18](#page--1-0)**); and

Step 3: finally, banks will have to map each of the components that are disclosed in Step 2 to the composition of capital disclosure templa
