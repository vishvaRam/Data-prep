 to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly.

## **General instructions:**

- Since public representative are the most important constituents of the DLRC forum, Lead banks must fix dates of DLRC meetings taking into account the convenience of the MPs and circulate the agenda papers to MPs well in advance.

- Deliberations in the DLRC forum may be held as per the indicative agenda. All other issues such as review of FIP, issues related to IT enabled FI, monitoring of FLCs and RSETIs, scaling up FL efforts, doubling farmers' income by 2022, SHG/ SME financing etc. should be deliberated in DCC as per extant instructions.
- Lead Banks should prepare an Annual Schedule of DLRC meetings on Calendar year basis for all districts in consultation with the Chairperson of the meetings, Lead District Officer of the RBI and Public Representatives. This yearly Calendar should be prepared in the beginning of each year and circulated to all members as advance intimation for blocking future dates to attend the DLRC meetings and the meetings should be conducted as per the calendar. While preparing the Calendar, it should be ensured that DCC and DLRC meetings are not held simultaneously.
- As per extant instructions on LBS, a pre-PLP meeting is required to be convened by LDM during June every year to be attended by banks, Government agencies, etc., to obtain their views and concerns regarding credit potential (sector/ activitywise) and deliberate on major financial and socio-economic developments in the district in the last one year and priorities to be set out for inclusion in the PLP. With a view to gain valuable insights on credit needs of the districts from public representatives who are well versed with the ground realities, DLRC for June quarter may be held prior to the pre-PLP meeting.
