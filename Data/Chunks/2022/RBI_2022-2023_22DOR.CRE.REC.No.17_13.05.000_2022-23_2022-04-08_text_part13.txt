ming together for the purpose of availing of bank loan either singly or through the group mechanism against mutual guarantee in order to engage in similar type of economic activities.

The SHG would normally consist of 10 to 20 members whereas a JLG would normally have between 4 and 10 members. Membership matters are governed by the bye laws adopted by the bank and provisions of respective State Co-operative Societies Acts or the Multi State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002. UCBs would, therefore, be required to be guided by the provisions contained in the respective Act and take prior approval of the RCS / CRCS, wherever required, while enrolling such members and granting loans to SHGs / JLGs. The bye-laws of UCBs also need to provide for such lending.

9.4 **Share Linking Norms:** The extant instructions on share linking to borrowing would apply for lending to SHGs / JLGs.

9.5 **Nature of Loan - Secured or Unsecured:** The extant limits (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.

9.6 **Nature of Exposure** - Individual or Group: Loans granted to SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on individual exposure limits.

9.7 **Amount of Loan:** The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit may be exceeded in case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc. JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the bank's assessment of the credit requirement.

9.8 **Margin and Security for the Loan:** Margin / security requirement will be as per Board approved policy of the UCB concerned.

9.9 **Documentation:** UCBs may prescribe simple documentation for loans to be granted to SHGs / JLGs keeping in view the purpose of the loan and the status of the borrower.

9.10 **Priority Sector:** Loans to SHGs / JLGs for agricultural and allied activities would be considered as priority sector advance. Further, other loans to SHGs / JLGs up to ₹50,000 would be considered as Micro Credit and hence treated as priority sector advances. Lending to SHGs, which qualify as loans to priority sector, would also be treated as part of lending to weaker sections.

9.11 **Opening of Savings Bank Account:** The SHGs / JLGs would be eligible to open Savings Bank account with UCBs.

9.12 **KYC Norms:** KYC verification of all the members of SHG need not be done while opening the savings bank account of the SHG and KYC verification of all the office bearers would suffice. As regards KYC verification at the time of credit linking of SHGs, as KYC would have already been verified while opening the savings bank account and the account continues to be in operation and is to be used for credit linkage, no separate KYC verification of the members or office bearers is necessary.

## **Revival of the Interest Tax Act 1974 - Collection from Borrowers**

10. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its Judgment dated April 16, 2004 has ordered that excess interest collected by the banks from the borrowers through rounding off the applicable interest rate should be recovered from the banks and credited to a Trust to be created for the benefit of disadvantaged people. The Hon'ble Court had also directed that each concerned bank shall contribute to the extent of ₹50 lakh to the said Fund. Accordingly, UCBs are advised that excess amount realised, if any, from their borrowers towards interest tax by way of rounding off, may be deposited with the above referred Trust Fund. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment has opened SB A/c No.65012067356 with the State Bank of Patiala, Shastri Bhavan Branch, New Delhi in the name of the Trust. UCBs, which have realised excess amount from the borrowers, towards interest tax by way of rounding off to the next higher 0.25% are liable to deposit the said amount to the Trust Fund. As regards contribution of ₹50 lakh to the Trust Fund, it is for the UCBs concerned which have collected excess amount, to decide depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.

Supreme Court in its Order dated February 21, 2014 in Writ Petition (Civil) No.301 of 2005 ordered that credit institutions which were in existence between October 1991 and March 1997 but were merged with another bank / financial institution prior to the date of the Supreme Court Order in April 2004 or merged subsequently, the transferee banks are liable to contribute to the extent of 50 lakh each as also deposit the excess amount collected by way of rounding off the intere
