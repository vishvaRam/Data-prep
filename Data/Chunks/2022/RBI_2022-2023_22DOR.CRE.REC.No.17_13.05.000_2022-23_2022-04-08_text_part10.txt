ing financial institutions like investment and financial companies as their members since it would be in contravention of the State Co-operative Societies Act concerned and will also not be in conformity with the provisions of model bye-law No.9 recommended for adoption, by all banks.

(ii) Therefore, the UCBs are not permitted to finance non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), other than those engaged in hire purchase / leasing.

### **7.3.2 Norms for financing**

(i) As in the case of finance and investment companies, admission of NBFCs which are not engaged exclusively in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be contrary to the provisions contained in the State Co-operative Societies Act concerned and model bye-law No.9 referred to above. It will, therefore, be necessary for banks to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting them as members.

(ii) Even financing the Companies involved in Leasing and hire purchase business by UCBs on a large scale is not favoured by the Reserve Bank of India, since the banks are basically required to cater to the credit needs of the people of small means.

(iii) Presently banks with working capital funds aggregating to ₹25 crore and above only are permitted to take up the financing of Companies involved in Leasing and hire purchase business and that too, only in consortium with other scheduled commercial banks. The banks should observe the following norms, while financing such companies:

(a) The level of finance to Companies involved in Leasing and hire purchase business depends on the net owned funds of the companies, subject to the overall ceiling on their borrowings upto ten times of their owned funds.

(b) Bank credit to companies engaged in equipment leasing and hire purchases (i.e., at least 75 per cent of assets are in equipment leasing / hire purchase and 75 per cent of their gross income is derived from these two types of activities as per their last audited balance sheet) may be extended within the ceiling of three times of the net owned funds within the overall ceiling of their borrowings upto ten times of net owned funds.

(c) In the case of other equipment leasing / hire purchases companies (i.e. companies whose assets in equipment leasing / hire purchase business are less than 75 per cent and whose gross income derived from these two types of activities as per the last audited balance sheet is less than 75 per cent of its gross income), the credit limit has to be within two times of their net owned funds from the present level of four times.

#### **7.4 Working Capital Finance to Information Technology and Software Industry**

7.4.1 In order to bring about uniformity in approach, Reserve Bank of India has formulated guidelines for information of banks, on various aspects of lending to information technology and software industry to facilitate free flow of credit. The same were enclosed to our circular DS.SUB.No.4/13.05.00/98-99 dated 5 October 1998, addressed to scheduled UCBs. Banks are, however, free to modify the guidelines based on their own experience without reference to Reserve Bank of India to achieve the purpose of the guidelines in letter and spirit.

7.4.2 These guidelines have been framed based on the recommendations made by the study group appointed by Reserve Bank of India to study the modalities of credit extension to software industry as also taking into account the suggestions made by the industry associations.

7.4.3 UCBs may take adequate steps to develop expertise in this area by training staff in project appraisal in the area of activity. It has to be ensured that the staff concerned is well aware of the requirements of the industry and remain in tune with the latest developments so that the higher standards of project appraisal can be maintained before extending the working capital finance to Information Technology and software industries.
