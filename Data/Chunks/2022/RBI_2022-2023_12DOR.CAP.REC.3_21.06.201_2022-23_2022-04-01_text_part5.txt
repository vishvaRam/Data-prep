m the average of the four quarters. The amount which can be reckoned would be arrived at by using the following formula:

EPt= {NPt – 0.25\*D\*t}

where;

EPt = Eligible profit up to the quarter 't' of the current financial year; t varies from 1 to 4

NPt = Net profit up to the quarter 't'

D= average annual dividend paid during last three years

It is clarified that the cumulative net loss up to the quarter end must be deducted while calculating CET1 capital for the relevant quarter.

(x) While calculating capital adequacy at the consolidated level, common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third parties (i.e., minority interest) which meet the criteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier 1 capital (refer to paragraph 4.3.2); and

(xi) Less: Regulatory adjustments / deductions applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 capital [i.e., to be deducted from the sum of items (i) to (x)].

## *B. Criteria for Classification as Common Shares for Regulatory Purposes*
