2 In cases of Sellers Line of Credit Scheme (since renamed as Direct Discounting Scheme) operated by IDBI Bank Ltd.[3](#page-0-0) and all India financial institutions like SIDBI, PFC, etc for sale of machinery, the primary credit is provided by the seller's bank to the seller through bills drawn on the buyer and the seller's bank has no access to the security covered by the transaction which remains with the buyer. As such, buyer's banks are permitted to extend guarantee/ co-acceptance facility for the bills drawn under seller's line of credit.
- 2.4.4.3 Similarly, guarantees can be issued in favour of HUDCO/ State Housing Boards and similar bodies/ organisations for the loans granted by them to private borrowers who are unable to offer clear and marketable title to property, provided banks are otherwise satisfied with the capacity of the borrowers to adequately service such loans.
- 2.4.4.4 Banks may issue guarantees in favour of various Development Agencies/Boards, like Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency, National Horticulture Board, etc. for obtaining soft loans and/or other forms of development assistance from such Agencies/Boards with the objective of improving efficiency, productivity, etc., subject to the following conditions:
	- (i) Banks should satisfy themselves, on the basis of credit appraisal, regarding the technical feasibility, financial viability and bankability of individual projects and/or loan proposals i.e. the standard of such appraisal should be the same, as is done in the case of a loan proposal seeking sanction of term finance/loan.
	- (ii) Banks should conform to the prudential exposure norms prescribed from time to time for an individual borrower/group of borrowers.
	- (iii) Banks should suitably secure themselves before extending such guarantees.

## **2.4.5 Infrastructure projects**

Keeping in view the special features of lending to infrastructure projects viz., the high degree of appraisal skills on the part of lenders and availability of resources of a maturity matching with the project period, banks have been given discretion in the matter of issuance of guarantees favouring other lending agencies, in respect of infrastructure projects alone, subject to the following conditions:

- (i) The bank issuing the guarantee takes a funded share in the project at least to the extent of 5 percent of the project cost and undertakes normal credit appraisal, monitoring and follow-up of the project.
- (ii) The guarantor bank has a satisfactory record in compliance with the prudential regulations, such as, capital adequacy, credit exposure, norms relating to income recognition, asset classification and provisioning, etc.

#### **2.5. Payment of invoked guarantees**

- **2.5.1** Where guarantees are invoked, payment should be made to the beneficiaries without delay and demur. An appropriate procedure for ensuring such immediate honouring of guarantees should be laid down so that there is no delay on the pretext that legal advice or approval of higher authorities is being obtained.
- **2.5.2** Delays on the part of banks in honouring the guarantees when invoked tend to erode the value of the bank guarantees, the sanctity of the scheme of guarantees and image of banks. It also provides an opportunity to the parties to take recourse to courts and obtain injunction orders. In the case of guarantees in favour of Government departments, this not only delays the revenue collection efforts but also gives an erroneous impression that banks are actively in collusion with the parties, which tarnishes the image of the banking system.
- **2.5.3** There should be an effective system to ensure that the persons on whose behalf the guarantees are issued will be in a position to perform their obligations in the case of performance guarantees and honour their commitments out of their own resources, as and when needed, in the case of financial guarantees.
- **2.5.4** The top management of the banks should bestow their personal attention to the need to put in place a proper mechanism for making payments in respect of invoked guarantees promptly, so that no room is given for such complaints. When complaints are made, particularly by the Government departments for not honouring the guarantees issued, the top management of the bank, including its Chief Executive Officer, should personally look into such complaints.
- **2.5.5** In this regard, the Delhi High Court has made adverse remarks against certain banks in not promptly honouring the commitment of guarantees when invoked. It has been observed that a bank guarantee is a contract between the beneficiary and the bank. When the beneficiary invokes the bank guarantee and a letter invoking the same is sent in terms of the bank guarantee, it is obligatory on the bank to make payment to the beneficiary.
