However, scheduled UCBs may sell a Government Security already contracted for purchase, provided:

- 4.2.3 the sale transaction will settle either in the same settlement cycle as the preceding purchase contract, or in a subsequent settlement cycle so that the delivery obligation under the sale contract is met by the securities acquired under the purchase contract (e.g. when a security is purchased on T+0 basis, it can be sold on either T+0 or T+1 basis on the day of the purchase; if however it is purchased on T+1 basis, it can be sold on T+1 basis on the day of purchase or on T+0 or T+1 basis on the next day). Sale of Government Securities allotted to successful bidders in primary issues on the day of allotment, with and between CSGL constituent account holders is permitted.

4.3 For purchase of securities from the Reserve Bank through Open Market Operations (OMO), no sale transactions should be contracted prior to receiving the confirmation of the deal/advice of allotment from the Reserve Bank.

The concurrent audit reports should contain specific observations on the compliance with the above instructions and should be incorporated in the monthly report to the Chairman/Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the bank and the half yearly review to be placed before the Board of Directors.

Any violation noticed in this regard should immediately be reported to the concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision, Reserve Bank of India. Any violation noticed in this regard would attract penalties as currently applicable to the bouncing of SGL even if the deal has been settled because of the netting benefit under DVP III, besides attracting further regulatory act
