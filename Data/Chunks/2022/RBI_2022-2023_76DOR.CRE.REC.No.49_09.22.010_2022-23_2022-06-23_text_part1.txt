#### **Master Circular**

## **Housing Finance for UCBs**


# **1. General**

1.1 The role of primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) in providing housing finance has been reviewed from time to time. These banks, with their vast network, occupy a very strategic position in the financial system and have an important role to play in providing credit to the housing sector. Further, housing finance to specified categories up to prescribed limits is treated as priority sector lending, and the need for UCBs providing credit to priority sector has come to be increasingly recognised consistent with the social objectives placed before the banking system.

1.2 Therefore, with a view to enabling the UCBs to play a more positive role in providing finance for housing schemes, particularly to the weaker sections of the community, these banks are permitted to grant loans for housing schemes up to certain limits from their own resources subject to the guidelines detailed hereunder.

1.3 Bigger banks that have large surplus resources may undertake larger lending for housing, as this will provide a remunerative avenue for investment of their surplus funds.

1.4 Wherever banks are still required to obtain special permission of the Registrar for financing housing societies, it is suggested that these banks should obtain general permission to finance housing societies subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed for the purpose.

# **2. Eligible Category of Borrowers**

UCBs may grant loans to the following categories of borrowers:

(a) Individuals and co-operative / group housing societies.

(b) Housing boards undertaking housing projects or schemes for economically weaker sections (EWS), low income groups (LIG) and middle income groups (MIG).

(c) Owners of houses / flats for extension and up-gradation, including major repairs.

## **3. Eligibility for Housing Finance**

The borrowers in the above categories will be eligible for finance for the following types of housing schemes:

(a) Construction / purchase of houses / flats by individuals

(b) Repairs, alterations and additions to houses / flats by individuals

(c) Schemes for housing and hostels for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes

(d) Under slum clearance schemes - directly to the slum dwellers on the guarantee of the Government, or indirectly through Statutory Boards established for this purpose

(e) Education, health, social, cultural or other institutions / centres which are part of a housing project and considered necessary for the development of settlements or townships

(f) Shopping centres, markets and such other centres catering to the day to day needs of the residents of the housing colonies and forming part of a housing project

## **4. Terms and Conditions for Housing Loans**

Finance provided by the UCBs to the eligible categories of borrowers for eligible housing schemes will be subject to the following terms and conditions:

## **4.1 Maximum Loan Amount & Margins**

(i) UCBs, based on their commercial judgment and other prudential business considerations, with the approval of their Board of Directors, are free to identify the eligible borrowers, decide margins and grant housing loans depending upon the repaying capacity of borrowers.

(ii) Tier-I UCBs are permitted to extend individual housing loans upto a maximum of ₹60 lakh per individual borrower and Tier II UCBs (UCBs other than Tier I) can extend individual housing loans up to a maximum of ₹140.00 lakh per individual borrower subject to extant prudential exposure limits.
