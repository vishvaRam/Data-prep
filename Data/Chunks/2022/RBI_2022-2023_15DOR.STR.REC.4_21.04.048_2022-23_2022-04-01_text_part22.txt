 Adjudicating Authority, as the case may be, and extant prudential norms. However, lenders shall not reverse the excess provisions held as on the date of submission of the resolution plan for approval of the Adjudicating Authority at this stage. In cases where the provisioning held is lower than the expected required provisioning, lenders shall make additional provisioning to the extent of the shortfall. Subsequent to the lapse of above mentioned period, provisioning shall be as per the norms laid out in Part A of this Master Circular. The facility of freezing of provisions shall also lapse immediately if the Adjudicating Authority rejects the resolution plan thus submitted. Asset classification in respect of such borrower shall continue be governed by the extant asset classification norms.

#### 19. Additional Finance

19.1 Any additional finance approved under the RP (including any resolution plan approved by the Adjudicating Authority under IBC) may be treated as 'standard asset' during the monitoring period under the approved RP, provided the account demonstrates satisfactory performance (as defined at footnote 16) during the monitoring period. If the restructured asset fails to perform satisfactorily during the monitoring period or does not qualify for upgradation at the end of the monitoring period, the additional finance shall be placed in the same asset classification category as the restructured debt.

19.2 Similarly, any interim finance [as defined in section 5 (15) of the IBC] extended by the lenders to debtors undergoing insolvency proceedings under IBC may be treated as 'standard asset' during the insolvency resolution process period as defined in the IBC. During this period, asset classification and provisioning for the interim finance shall be governed by the norms laid down in Part A of this Master Circular. Subsequently, upon approval of the resolution plan by the Adjudicating Authority, treatment of such interim finance shall be as per the norms applicable to additional finance, as per Paragraph 19.1 above.

#### 20. Income recognition norms

20.1 Interest income in respect of restructured accounts classified as 'standard assets' may be recognized on accrual basis and that in respect of the restructured accounts classified as 'nonperforming assets' shall be recognised on cash basis.

20.2 In the case of additional finance in accounts where the pre-restructuring facilities were classified as NPA, the interest income shall be recognised only on cash basis except when the restructuring is accompanied by a change in ownership.

21.1 An act of restructuring might create new securities issued by the borrower which would be held by the lenders in lieu of a portion of the pre-restructured exposure. The FITL / debt / equity instruments created by conversion of principal / unpaid interest, as the case may be, shall be placed in the same asset classification category in which the restructured advance has been classified.

21.2 The provisioning applicable to such instruments shall be the higher of:

a) The provisioning applicable to the asset classification category in which such instruments are held; or

b) The provisioning applicable based on the fair valuation of such instruments as provided in the following paragraphs.

21.3 Debt/quasi-debt/equity instruments[21](#page-2-0) acquired by the lenders as part of a RP shall be valued as under:

- a) Debentures/bonds shall be valued as per the instructions contained in paragraph 10 of the [Master Direction - Prudential Norms for Classification, Valuation and](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12153)  [Operation of Investment Portfolio by Banks dated August 25, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12153) (as amended from time to time).
