### 28. Wilful Defaulters and Non-Cooperative Borrowers

Instructions regarding treatment of Wilful Defaulters are contained in our [Master Circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9044)  [DBR.No.CID.BC.57/20.16.003/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9044) (updated up to January 7, 2015) on 'Wilful Defaulters' as updated from time to time. Banks are required to strictly adhere to these guidelines. In addition to these instructions and with a view to ensuring better corporate governance structure in companies and ensuring accountability of independent/professional directors, promoters, auditors, etc. henceforth, the following prudential measures will be applicable:

a) The provisioning in respect of existing loans/exposures of banks to companies having director/s (other than nominee directors of government/financial institutions brought on board at the time of distress), whose name/s appear more than once in the list of wilful defaulters, will be 5% in cases of standard accounts; if such account is classified as NPA, it will attract accelerated provisioning as under:


b) This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures to such borrowers are likely to be higher. It is reiterated that no additional facilities should be granted by any bank/FI to the listed wilful defaulters, in terms of Paragraph 2.5 (a) of [Master Circular on](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9907)  [Wilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9907)

- c) With a view to discouraging borrowers/defaulters from being unreasonable and noncooperative with lenders in their bonafide resolution/recovery efforts, banks may classify such borrowers as non-cooperative borrowers [23](#page-3-0) , after giving them due notice if satisfactory clarifications are not furnished. Banks will be required to report classification of such borrowers to CRILC. Detailed instructions in this regard have been issued vide [circular DBR.No.CID.BC.54/20.16.064/2014-15 dated December 22, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9420&Mode=0) on Non-Cooperative Borrowers.
- d) Further, if any particular entity is reported as non-cooperative, any fresh exposure to such a borrower will, by implication, entail greater risk necessitating higher provisioning. Banks/FIs will therefore be required to make higher provisioning as applicable to substandard assets in respect of new loans sanctioned to such borrowers as also new loans sanctioned to any other company that has on its board of directors an
