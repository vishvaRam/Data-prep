Madam / Dear Sir,

## **Cassette - Swaps in ATMs**

Please refer to the circulars [RBI/2017-18/162/ DCM \(Plg.\) No. 3641/10.25.007/2017-18](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11256&Mode=0)  [dated April 12, 2018](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11256&Mode=0) and [RBI/2021-22/71/ DCM \(Plg.\) No.S39/10.25.007/2021-22 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12130&Mode=0)  [July 12, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12130&Mode=0) on the captioned subject wherein banks were advised to consider using lockable cassettes in their ATMs which shall be swapped at the time of cash replenishment. The same was advised to be implemented in a phased manner covering at least one third ATMs operated by the banks every year, such that all ATMs achieve cassette swap by March 31, 2021, which was later extended to March 31, 2022.

2. In this regard, representations have been received from various banks and Indian Banks' Association expressing difficulties in meeting the timeline. Accordingly, it has been decided to extend the timeline for implementation of cassette swap in all ATMs till March 31, 2023.

3. Banks shall set a Board approved internal timeline to adhere to the extended deadline and submit quarterly status reports. Boards of the banks shall monitor the progress to ensure compliance.

4. All other instructions contained in the circulars *ibid* remain unchanged.

Yours faithfully,

(Suman Ray) Chief General Manager-in-Charge
