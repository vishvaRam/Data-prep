Madam/Sir,

## **Guidelines on Compensation of Key Managerial Personnel (KMP) and Senior Management in NBFCs**

As you are aware, a revised Scale Based Regulatory (SBR) framework for NBFCs was put in place vide [circular DOR.CRE.REC.No.60/03.10.001/2021-22 October 22,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0)  [2021.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12179&Mode=0) In terms of para 3.2.3 (h) of the said circular, in order to address issues arising out of excessive risk taking caused by misaligned compensation packages, NBFCs are required to put in place a Board approved compensation policy. The policy shall at the minimum include, (a) constitution of a Remuneration Committee, (b) principles for fixed/ variable pay structures, and (c) malus/ clawback provisions. Further, in terms of para 3.2.3 (i) it was also decided that the Board of NBFCs should delineate the role of various committees, including Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC). It was envisaged that detailed circulars will be issued in due course by the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, these guidelines have now been framed and furnished in [Annex.](#page-2-0)

2. The guidelines are intended only for providing broad guidance to NBFCs and their NRCs in formulating their compensation policy. While formulating the compensation policy, it has to be ensured that all statutory mandates and the rules and directions issued under them are fully complied with.

#### **1. Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC)**

The Boards of all applicable NBFCs shall constitute a Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC). The NRC shall have the constitution, powers, functions and duties as laid down in section 178 of the Companies Act, 2013. The NRC, *inter alia,* shall also have the mandate to oversee the framing, review and implementation of compensation policy of the company which should have the approval of the board. The NRC may work in close coordination with Risk Management Committee (RMC) of the company to achieve effective alignment between compensation and risks. Further, the NRC may ensure that compensation levels are supported by the need to retain earnings of the company and the need to maintain adequate capital based on Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). NRC may also ensure 'fit and proper' status of proposed/existing directors and that there is no conflict of interest in appointment of directors on Board of the company, KMPs and senior management.

The compensation packages may comprise of fixed and variable pay components aligned effectively with prudent risk taking to ensure that compensation is adjusted for all types of risks, the compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes, compensation pay-outs are sensitive to the time horizon of the risks, and the mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are consistent with risk alignment.

**2.2 Composition of Fixed Pay:** All the fixed items of compensation, including the perquisites and contributions towards superannuation/retiral benefits, may be treated as part of fixed pay. All perquisites that are reimbursable may also be
