ms and conditions of its sanction.

f. The asset classification as on the date of natural calamity will continue, if the restructuring is completed within a period of three months from the date of natural calamity. The restructured accounts would, otherwise, be governed by provisions of circular UBD.BPD.No.30/09.09.001/05-06 dated March 9, 2006. Further, the guidelines applicable to sub-standard accounts, will apply, mutatis mutandis to doubtful accounts.

g. In retail or consumer loans segment, the banks may restructure the loans in a manner suitable to the borrowers on a case-to-case basis.

### **14. Scale of Finance**

Scale of finance in respect of different crops will be uniform in a district. The scales will be fixed taking into account the prevailing conditions and norms presently adopted by different lending agencies. In fixing the scales, minimum consumption needs of borrowers will be taken into account. The concerned District Magistrate and Managers of branches of banks operating in the district would be advised to adopt the scales so laid down.

#### **15. Development Loans - Investment Costs**

i) The existing term loan instalments will have to be rescheduled / postponed keeping in view the repaying capacity of the borrowers and the nature of natural calamity viz.,

a) Droughts, floods or cyclones etc. where only crop for that year is damaged and productive assets are not damaged.

b) Floods or cyclones where the productive assets are partially or totally damaged and borrowers are in need of a new loan.

ii) In regard to natural calamity under category (a), the banks may postpone the payment of instalment during the year of natural calamity and extend the loan period by one year except (subject to the following exceptions) -

a) Those cultivators who had not effected the development or investment for which the loan was obtained or had disposed of the equipment or machinery purchased out of the loan.

b) Those who are income tax payers.

c) In the case of drought, those who are having perennial sources of irrigation except where water supply was not released from canals or irrigation facility was not available from other perennial sources.

d) Tractor owners, except in genuine case where there is loss of income and consequential impairment of their repaying capacity.

iii) Under this arrangement the instalments defaulted wilfully in earlier years will not be eligible for rescheduling. The banks may have to postpone payment of interest by borrowers. While fixing extension of period the commitment towards interest may also be taken into account.

iv) In regard to category (i)(b) above, i.e., where the borrower's assets are totally damaged, the rescheduling by way of extension of loan period may be determined on the basis of overall repaying capacity of the borrower including his repayment commitment on the old term loans and towards the conversion loan (medium term loan) on account of postponing of repayment of short-term loans and the fresh crop loan. In such cases, the repayment period of total loan (including interest liability) less the subsidies received from the Government agencies, compensation available under the insurance schemes, etc. may be fixed having regard to the repaying capacity of the borrower subject to a maximum of 15 years, depending upon the type of investment as well as the economic (useful) life of the new asset financed, except in cases where loans relate to land shaping, silt removal, soil conservation etc. Thus in the case of loans for agricultural machineries, viz. pump-sets and tractors, it should be ensured that the total loan period does not generally exceed 9 years from the date of advance.

16. Apart from rescheduling existing term loans, banks will provide to affected farmers diverse type of term loans for developmental purposes, such as:

# **i) Minor Irrigation**

Term loans for repairs to wells, pump-sets, etc. which are to be quantified after assessing the extent of damage and estimated cost of repairs.

## **ii) Bullocks**

Where the drought animals have been washed away, requests for fresh loans for a new pair of bullocks / he-buffaloes may be considered. Where loans are given for purchase of new cattle or where farmers have bought milch cattle, reasonable credit may be given for purchase of fodder or feed.

## **iii) Milch Cattle**

Term loan for milch cattle will be considered depending upon breed, milk yield, etc., the loan amount will include repairs to shelters, purchase of equipment and feed.

#### **iv) Insurance**

Considering the proneness of areas to cyclones and other natural calamities, the cattle should be insured instead of Risk-cum-Mortality Fund established for similar purpose in other safe areas. Milch animals / draught cattle should be branded for identification as also to serve as safeguard against their re-sale by the beneficiaries.

# **v) Poultry and Piggery**

For poultry, piggery and rearing of goats, loans will be considered as per n
