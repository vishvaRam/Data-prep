ojects delayed for other reasons beyond the control of promoters*

# *4.2.15.3 Projects under Implementation â€“ Change in Ownership*

4.2.15.3.1 In order to facilitate revival of the projects stalled primarily due to inadequacies of the current promoters, if a change in ownership takes place any time during the periods quoted in Paragraph 4.2.15.2 above or before the original DCCO, banks may permit extension of the DCCO of the project up to two years in addition to the periods quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 above, as the case may be, without any change in asset classification of the account subject to the conditions stipulated in the following paragraphs. Banks may also consequentially shift/extend repayment schedule, if required, by an equal or shorter duration.

4.2.15.3.2 In cases where change in ownership and extension of DCCO (as indicated in Paragraph 4.2.15.3.1 above) takes place before the original DCCO, and if the project fails to commence commercial operations by the extended DCCO, the project will be eligible for further extension of DCCO in terms of guidelines quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2 above. Similarly, where change in ownership and extension of DCCO takes place during the period quoted in Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iii)(a) above, the account may still be restructured by extension of DCCO in terms of guidelines quoted at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iv) above, without classifying the account as non-performing asset.

4.2.15.3.3 The provisions of Paragraphs 4.2.15.3.1 and 4.2.15.3.2 above are subject to the following conditions:

a) Banks should establish that implementation of the project is stalled/affected primarily due to inadequacies of the current promoters/management and with a change in ownership there is a very high probability of commencement of commercial operations by the project within the extended period;

b) The project in consideration should be taken-over/acquired by a new promoter/promoter group with sufficient expertise in the field of operation. If the acquisition is being carried out by a special purpose vehicle (domestic or overseas), the bank should be able to clearly demonstrate that the acquiring entity is part of a new promoter group with sufficient expertise in the field of operation;

c) The new promoters should own at least 51 per cent of
