n order to achieve this, banks should cap the number of shares and / or voting rights in accordance with relevant laws and regulations on Ownership and Governance of banks. Banks should adequately incorporate these features in the terms and conditions of the instruments in the offer document. In exceptional circumstances, if the breach is inevitable, the bank should immediately

<sup>224</sup> Market price here does not mean the price prevailing on the date of conversion; banks can use any pricing formula such as weighted average price of shares during a particular period before conversion.

inform the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Regulation) about it. The investors will be required to bring the shareholdings below the statutory / regulatory ceilings within the specific time frame as determined by the Reserve Bank of India.

2.18 In the case of unlisted banks, the conversion price should be determined based on the fair value of the bank's common shares to be estimated according to a mutually acceptable methodology which should be in conformity with the standard market practice for valuation of shares of unlisted companies.

2.19 In order to ensure the criteria that the issuing bank must maintain at all times all prior authorisation necessary to immediately issue the relevant number of shares specified in the instrument's terms and conditions should the trigger event occur, the capital clause of each bank will have to be suitably modified to take care of conversion aspects.

# *V. Order of Conversion / Write-down of Various Types of AT1 Instruments*

2.20 Banks should clearly indicate in the offer document, the order of conversion / write-down of the instrument in question vis-Ã -vis other capital instruments which the bank has already issued or may issue in future, based on the advice of its legal counsels.

# **3. Minimum Requirements to Ensure Loss Absorbency of Non-equity Regulatory Capital Instruments at the Point of Non-Viability**

## *I. Mode of Loss Absorption and Trigger Event*

3.1 The terms and conditions of all non-common equity Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments issued by banks in India must have a provision that requires such instruments, at the option of the Reserve Bank of India, to either be written off or converted into common equity upon the occurrence of the trigger event, called the 'Point of Non-Viability (PONV) Trigger' stipulated below:

#### *(i) The PONV Trigger event is the earlier of:*

a. a decision that a conversion<sup>225</sup> or write-off<sup>226</sup>, without which the firm would become non-viable, is necessary, as determined by the Reserve Bank of India; and

b. the decision to make a public sector injection of capital, or equivalent support, without which the firm would have become non-viable, as determined by the relevant authority.

The Write-off of any Common Equity Tier 1 capital shall not be required before the write-off of any Non-equity (Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2) regulatory capital instrument.

<sup>225</sup> Conversion means full conversion to common shares.

<sup>226</sup> Write-off means fully and permanently write-off.

(ii) Such a decision would invariably imply that the write-off or issuance of any new shares as a result of conversion consequent upon the trigger event must occur prior to any public sector injection of capital so that the capital provided by the public sector is not diluted. As such, the contractual terms and conditions of an instrument must not provide for any residual claims on the issuer which are senior to ordinary shares of the bank (or banking group entity where applicable), following a trigger event and when conversion or write-off is undertaken.

(iii) Any compensation paid to the instrument holders as a result of the write-off<sup>227</sup> must be paid immediately in the form of common shares.

(iv) The issuing bank must maintain at all times all prior authorisation necessary to immediately issue the relevant number of shares specified in the instrument's terms and conditions should the trigger event occur.

(v) In order to ensure that these requirements are met, banks should obtain and keep on their records an external legal opinion confirming that the conversion or write-off feature of non-equity capital instruments (Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2) by the RBI at the point of non-viability is legally enforceable. Further, the legal opinion should also confirm that there are no legal impediments to the conversion of the instrument into ordinary shares of the bank (or a banking group entity, where applicable) or write-off upon a trigger event. The RBI may also require the bank to submit additional information in order to ensure that such instruments are eligible for inclusion into regulatory capital.

#### *II. A Non-viable Bank*

#### 3.2 For the purpose of these directions, a non-viable bank will be:

A bank which, owing to its financial and other dif
