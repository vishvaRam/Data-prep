**Structure**



### **Introduction**

(i) The genesis of the Lead Bank Scheme (LBS) can be traced to the Study Group headed by Prof. D. R. Gadgil (Gadgil Study Group) on the Organizational Framework for the Implementation of the Social Objectives, which submitted its report in October 1969. The Study Group drew attention to the fact that commercial banks did not have adequate presence in rural areas and also lacked the required rural orientation. The Study Group, therefore, recommended the adoption of an 'Area Approach' to evolve plans and programmes for the development of an adequate banking and credit structure in the rural areas.

(ii) A Committee of Bankers on Branch Expansion Programme of Public Sector Banks appointed by the Reserve Bank of India under the Chairmanship of Shri F. K. F. Nariman (Nariman Committee) endorsed the idea of an 'Area Approach' in its report (November 1969), recommending that in order to enable the Public Sector Banks to discharge their social responsibilities, each bank should concentrate on certain districts where it should act as a 'Lead Bank'.

(iii) Pursuant to the above recommendations, the Lead Bank Scheme was introduced by the Reserve Bank of India in December 1969.The Scheme aims at coordinating the activities of banks and other developmental agencies through various fora in order to achieve the objective of enhancing the flow of bank finance to the priority sector and other sectors and to promote banks' role in the overall development of the rural sector. For coordinating the activities in the district, a particular bank is assigned 'Lead Bank' responsibility of the district. The Lead Bank is expected to assume a leadership role for coordinating the efforts of the credit institutions and the Government.

(iv) In view of the several changes that had taken place in the financial sector, the Lead Bank Scheme was last reviewed by the High Level Committee headed by Smt. Usha Thorat, former Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India in 2009.

(v) The High Level Committee held wide ranging discussions with various stakeholders viz. State Governments, banks, development institutions, academicians, NGOs, MFIs etc. and noted that the Scheme has been useful in achieving its original objectives of improvement in branch expansion, deposit mobilisation and lending to the priority sector, especially in rural/semi urban areas. There was overwhelming consensus that the Scheme needs to continue. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the guidelines were issued to SLBC Convenor banks and Lead Banks for implementation.

(vi) Envisaging greater role for private sector banks, Lead Banks were advised to ensure that private sector banks are more closely and actively involved in the implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme, by leveraging on Information Technology and bringing in their expertise in strategic planning. They were also advised to involve themselves in the preparation as well as implementation of the District Credit Plan(DCP).

(vii) Further, Reserve Bank of India constituted a "Committee of Executive Directors" of the Bank to study the efficacy of the Scheme and suggest measures for its improvement. Based on the Committee's recommendations and feedback received from various stakeholders, certain 'action points' were issued to SLBC Convenors/Lead Banks and NABARD on April 6, 2018.
