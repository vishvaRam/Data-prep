f the entire amount agreed upon in one instalment, the proposals should be in line with and supported by an acceptable business plan, projected earnings and cash flows of the borrower; (d) The proposal should not materially affect the asset liability management of the ARC or the commitments given to investors; (e) The Board of Directors may delegate powers to a committee comprising any director and/ or any functionaries of the company for taking decisions on proposals for settlement of dues; (f) Deviation from the policy should be made only with the approval of the Board of Directors.

director and/ or any functionaries of the ARC for taking decisions on the proposals for settlement of dues. On a review, the guidelines for the reconstruction of financial assets through settlement of dues payable by the borrowers have been modified as follows:

- a) Settlement of dues with the borrower shall be done only after the proposal is examined by an Independent Advisory Committee (IAC)[3](#page-0-0) which shall consist of professionals having technical/ finance/ legal background. IAC, after assessing the financial position of the borrower, the time frame available for recovery of the dues from the borrower, projected earnings & cash flows of the borrower and other relevant aspects, shall give its recommendations to the ARC regarding settlement of dues with the borrower.
- b) The Board of Directors including at least two independent directors shall deliberate on the recommendations of IAC and consider the various options available for recovery of dues before deciding whether the option of settlement of dues with the borrower is the best option available under the existing circumstances and the decision, along with detailed rationale, shall be specifically recorded in the minutes of the Board meeting.
- c) Settlement with the borrower should be done only after all possible steps to recover the dues have been taken and there are no further prospects of recovering the debt.
- d) The Net Present Value (NPV) of the settlement amount should generally be not less than the realizable value of securities. If there is a significant variation between the valuation of securities recorded at the time of acquisition of financial assets and the realisable value assessed at the time of entering into a settlement, reasons thereof shall be duly recorded.

<span id="page-0-0"></span> <sup>3</sup> Under extant guidelines, an ARC is required to constitute an IAC for examining the proposals related to change in or takeover of management of business of the borrower. This IAC shall also now examine the proposals of settlement of dues with the borrower.

- e) The settlement amount should preferably be paid in lump sum. In cases where the borrower is unable to pay the entire amount in lump sum, IAC shall make specific recommendations about minimum upfront lump-sum payment and maximum repayment period.
- f) ARCs shall frame a Board-approved policy based on the above-mentioned framework.
- (ii) Instructions given under paragraph 2(B)[4](#page-1-0) of the [circular DNBS.\(PD\).CC.No.37/ SCRC/](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8776&Mode=0)  [26.03.001/ 2013-2014](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8776&Mode=0) dated March 19, 2014 on 'Buyback of assets from ARCs by the defaulters and acquisition of assets by ARCs from sponsor banks' are hereby withdrawn and ARCs shall ensure compliance with Section 29A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 in dealing with the prospective buyers.

### **9. Policy on Management Fees**

The [circular DOR.NBFC\(ARC\) CC. No. 9/26.03.001/2020-21](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11937&Mode=0) dated July 16, 2020 on Fair Practices Code (FPC) requires ARCs to put in place a Board-approved policy on the management fee, expenses and incentives. In order to ensure that management fee/ incentives charged by ARCs are reasonable and transparent, the following additional measures shall be adopted:

<span id="page-1-0"></span><sup>4</sup> Promoters of the defaulting company/ borrowers or guarantors are allowed to buy back their assets from the ARCs provided the following conditions are met:

I. Such a settlement is considered helpful in (i) minimizing or eliminating the cost of litigation and the attendant loss of time;(ii) arresting the negative impact of diminution in the value of secured assets which are likely to rapidly lose value once a unit becomes non-operational;(iii) where the recovery/ resolution process would appear to be rather uncertain; and iv) where such settlement will be beneficial for restructuring purposes.

II. The valuation of the asset is worked out by the ARCs after factoring in the following components: The current value of the proposed settlement (valuation of the asset not more than six months old) vis-Ã -vis the net present value of the recoveries under the alternative mode of resolution taking into consideration the timelines involved therein; L
