#### **12. Investments**

[32](#page-3-0)(i) Considering nature of investment in SRs where underlying cash flows are dependent on realization from non-performing assets, it can be classified as available for sale. Hence investments in SRs may be aggregated for the purpose of arriving at net depreciation/ appreciation of investments under the category. Net depreciation, if any shall be provided for. Net Appreciation, if any should be ignored.

(ii) All other investments should be valued at lower of cost or realisable value. Where market rates are available, the market value would be presumed to be the realisable value and in cases where market rates are not available, the realisable value should be the fair value. However, investments in other registered ARC shall be treated as long term investments and valued in accordance with the Accounting Standards and Guidance notes issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).

[34\(](#page-4-0)iii) Management fees should be calculated and charged as a percentage of the NAV calculated at the lower end of the range of the Recovery Rating specified by the Credit Rating Agency (CRA) provided that the same is not more than the acquisition value of the underlying asset.

Management fees may be recognized on accrual basis. Management fees recognized **during** the planning period must be realized within 180 days from the date of expiry of the planning period. Management fees recognized **after** the planning period should be realized within 180 days from the date of recognition. Unrealised Management fees should be reversed thereafter. Further any unrealized Management fees will be reversed if before the prescribed time for realisation, NAV of the SRs fall below 50% of face value. However, ARCs are allowed to write off the accrued unrealised Management Fee receivables prior to March 31, 2014 in a staggered manner in four half-yearly instalments over a period of two years, 2014-15 and 2015-16 subject to the disclosure of age wise such receivables in the Balance Sheet of the company.
