Dear Sir/Madam

# **Gold Monetization Scheme (GMS), 2015**

In exercise of the powers conferred on the Reserve Bank of India under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI makes the following amendments in the Reserve Bank of India (Gold Monetization Scheme, 2015) Master [Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10084) [No.DBR.IBD.No.45/23.67.003/2015-16](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10084) dated October 22, 2015, with immediate effect.

2. The existing sub-para 2.2.2.(v) stands deleted (and hence the existing sub-paras 2.2.2.(vi) to 2.2.2.(viii) have accordingly been renumbered). The corresponding provisions have been suitably incorporated in sub-para 2.4.i.(a) and 2.4.i.(b).

3. The sub-para 2.2.2.(vii) has been amended to read as follows:

"Central Government has decided that with effect from November 5, 2016, designated banks will be paid handling charges (including gold purity testing, refining, transportation, storage and any other relevant costs) for a new MLTGD at a flat rate of 1.5% and commission at the rate of 1% of the rupee equivalent of the amount of gold mobilized under the scheme until further notice. In case of renewal of deposits, as banks will not incur any expenses on purity testing, refining, transportation, storage and insurance etc., the banks will only be given a fixed commission of 1% of the rupee equivalent of the amount of gold on the date of renewal towards their administrative and account maintenance cost."

4. A new sub-para 2.4 has been inserted (and hence the existing sub-paras 2.4 to 2.10 have accordingly been renumbered) which reads as follows -

## **Guidelines for Renewal/Redemption of MLTGD**

#### **i. General**

- a. The redemption of principal at maturity shall, at the option of the depositor, be either in Indian Rupee equivalent of the value of deposited gold at the time of redemption, or in gold. However, any premature redemption of MLTGD shall be only in INR. The designated bank shall seek the option of collecting maturing proceeds in gold or in Indian Rupee equivalent from the depositor at the time of initial deposit. Additionally, nominee details along with their share in the maturity proceeds may also be ascertained by the bank at the time of opening the account. In case of existing accounts, designated banks shall ensure the availability of the aforementioned information and submit a compliance report to RBI within six months from the date of issue of these directions.
- b. The interest accrued on MLTGD shall be calculated with reference to Indian Rupee equivalent of value of gold at the time of deposit and will be paid only in INR.
- c. Designated banks shall inform the depositors about redemption through letter and other means (such as SMS, email, phone call etc. wherever details are available), at least 120 days prior to redemption date and ask them to submit their response within 30 days on their preference for redemption or renewal. The bank, in its communication, should include a list of its state-wise branches where the facility of redemption in gold is available while also clearly specifying the additional administrative charges to be borne by the depositor for redemption in gold. In its communication to the depositor, the bank shall ask for options on the following:
	- (i) Renewal or Redemption
	- (ii) Redemption in gold or in INR (only for depositors who sought redemption in gold at the time of deposit), along with the name of the branch from where the depositor will collect the gold, as applicable
- d. The depositor shall be required to present the original deposit certificate issued by the corresponding designated bank for redemption/renewal/premature closure of the MLTGD.
- e. In case of redemption in INR, if the original saving/current account provided to the bank at the time of deposit is not operational, the depositor shall provide details of the alternate saving/current account to the concerned bank.
- f. Deposits maturing on non-business day shall be redeemed on the next working day without any interest for the intervening period.
- g. In case a deposit is not redeemed on the due date, or the deposit certificate is presented for redemption after due date, no interest will be paid on the outstanding deposit for the period overdue.
