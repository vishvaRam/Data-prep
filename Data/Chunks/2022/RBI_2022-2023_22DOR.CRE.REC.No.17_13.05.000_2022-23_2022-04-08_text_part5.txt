ments and according to the bank's prescribed lending norms.

#### **Valuation of properties-empanelment of valuers**

4.9 The issue of correct and realistic valuation of fixed assets owned by banks and that accepted by them as collateral for a sizable portion of their advances portfolio assumes significance in view of its implications for correct measurement of capital adequacy position of banks. UCBs are, therefore, advised to put in place a system / procedure for realistic valuation of fixed assets and also for empanelment of valuers for the purpose as per guidelines given at [Annex 1.](#page--1-0)

# **Diversion of Funds**

4.10 UCBs should have a mechanism for proper monitoring of the end use of funds. Wherever diversion is observed, they should take appropriate action including recalling the loans, reduction of sanctioned limits, charging penal interest etc. to protect the bank's interest. UCBs should keep a proper vigil over requests of their clients for cash withdrawals from their accounts for large amounts. Whenever stocks under hypothecation to cash credit and other loan accounts are found to have been sold but the proceeds thereof not credited to the loan account, such action should normally be treated as a fraud. In such cases, banks may take immediate steps to secure the remaining stock so as to prevent further erosion in the value of the available security as also other action as warranted.

4.11 Diversion of funds would be construed to include any one of the under-noted occurrences:

a) utilisation of short-term working capital funds for long-term purposes not in conformity with the terms of sanctions;

b) deploying borrowed funds for purposes / activities or creation of assets other than those for which the loan was sanctioned;

c) transferring funds to the subsidiaries / group companies or other corporates by whatever modalities;

d) routing of funds through any bank other than the lender bank or members of consortium without prior permission of the lender;

e) investment in other companies by way of acquiring equities / debt instruments without approval of lenders;

f) shortfall in deployment of funds vis-a-vis the amounts disbursed / drawn, and the difference not being accounted for.

4.12 Siphoning of funds should be construed to have occurred if any funds borrowed are utilised for purposes unrelated to the operations of the borrower, to the detriment of the financial health of the entity or of the lender. The decision as to whether a particular instance amounts to siphoning of funds would have to be a judgement of the lenders based on objective facts and circumstances of the case.

## **End-use of Funds**

4.13 In cases of project financing, banks should seek to ensure end use of funds by, inter alia, obtaining certification from the Chartered Accountants for the purpose. In case of short-term corporate / clean loans, such an approach ought to be supplemented by 'due diligence' on the part of lenders themselves, and to the extent possible, such loans should be limited to only those borrowers whose integrity and reliability were above board. UCBs, therefore, should not depend entirely on the certificates issued by the Chartered Accountants but strengthen their internal controls and the credit risk management system to enhance the quality of their loan portfolio. Needless to say, ensuring end-use of funds by banks should form a part of their loan policy document for which appropriate measures should be put in place.

4.14 The following are the illustrative measures that could be taken by the lenders for monitoring and ensuring end-use of funds:

(a) Meaningful scrutiny of quarterly progress reports / operating statements / balance sheets of the borrowers;

(b) Regular inspection of borrowers' assets charged to the lenders as security;

(c) Periodic scrutiny of borrowers' books of accounts and the no-lien accounts maintained with other banks;

(d) Periodic visits to the assisted units;

(e) System of periodical stock audit, in case of working capital finance;

(f) Periodic comprehensive management audit of the 'Credit' function of the lenders, so as to identify the systemic weaknesses in the credit-administration.
