emaining unrealised, should be reversed or provided for in the current accounting period.

## 3.3 Appropriation of recovery in NPAs

3.3.1 Interest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the accounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities sanctioned to the borrower concerned.

3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due), banks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner.

# 3.4 Interest Application

On an account turning NPA, banks should reverse the interest already charged and not collected by debiting Profit and Loss account and stop further application of interest. However, banks may continue to record such accrued interest in a Memorandum account in their books. For the purpose of computing Gross Advances, interest recorded in the Memorandum account should not be taken into account.

## 3.5 Computation of NPA levels

Banks are advised to compute their Gross Advances, Net Advances, Gross NPAs and Net NPAs, as per the format in **[Annex -1](#page--1-0)**.

## 4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION

## 4.1 Categories of NPAs

Banks are required to classify non-performing assets further into the following three categories based on the period for which the asset has remained non-performing and the realisability of the dues:

- **(i) Substandard Assets**
- **(ii) Doubtful Assets**
- **(iii) Loss Assets**

#### 4.1.1 Substandard Assets

With effect from March 31, 2005, a substandard asset would be one, which has remained NPA for a period less than or equal to 12 months. Such an asset will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected.

## 4.1.2 Doubtful Assets

With effect from March 31, 2005, an asset would be classified as doubtful if it has remained in the substandard category for a period of 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in assets that were classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, – on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values – highly questionable and improbable.

## 4.1.3 Loss Assets

A loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors or the RBI inspection, but the amount has not been written off wholly. In other words, such an asset is considered uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value.

## 4.2 Guidelines for classification of assets

#### 4.2.1 General

Broadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into account the degree of well-defined credit weaknesses.

## 4.2.2 Appropriate internal systems for proper and timely identification of NPAs

Banks should establish appropriate internal systems (including technology enabled processes) for proper and timely identification of NPAs, including putting in place the necessary infrastructure to comply with the requirements of the [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11964&Mode=0)  [DoS.CO.PPG./SEC.03/11.01.005/2020-21 dated September 14, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11964&Mode=0) on Automation of Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning processes in banks (as updated).

#### 4.2.3 Availability of security / net worth of borrower/ guarantor

The availability of security or net worth of borrower/ guarantor should not be taken into account for the purpose of treating an advance as NPA or otherwise, except to the extent provided in Paragraph 4.2.9.

#### 4.2.4 Accounts with temporary deficiencies

The classification of an asset as NPA should be based on the record of recovery. Bank should not classify an advance account as NPA merely due to the existence of some deficiencies which are temporary in nature such as non-availability of adequate drawing power based on the latest available stock statement, balance outstanding exceeding the limit temporarily, nonsubmission of stock statements and non-renewal of the limits on the due date, etc. In the matter of classification of accounts with such deficiencies banks may follow the following guidelines:

- a) Banks should ensure that drawings in the working capital accounts are covered by the adequacy of current assets, since current assets are first appropriated in times of distress. Drawing power is required to be arrived at based on the stock statement which is current. However, considering the difficulties of large borrowers, stock statements relied upon by the banks for determining drawing power should not be o
