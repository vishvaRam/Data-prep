Please refer t[o Circulars DGBA.GBD.No.S140/42.01.029/2020-21 dated March 18, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12040&Mode=0) and [DGBA.GBD.No.S26/42.01.029/2021-22 dated April 7, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12072&Mode=0) advising the procedure to be followed for reporting and accounting of Central Government transactions (including CBDT, CBIC, Departmentalized Ministries and Non-Civil Ministries) at the Receiving/Nodal/Focal Point branches of your bank for the Financial Year 2020-21.

2. The Government of India has decided that the date of closure of residual transactions for the month of March 2022 be fixed as April 11, 2022. In view of the ensuing closing of government accounts for the financial year 2021-22, receiving branches including those not situated locally, should adopt special arrangements such as courier service etc., for passing on challans/scrolls etc., to the Nodal/Focal Point branches so that all payments and collections made on behalf of government towards the end of March are accounted for in the same financial year. These instructions regarding special messenger arrangements may please be informed to all branches concerned.

3. As regards reporting of March 2022 transactions by Nodal/Focal Point branches in April 2022, the branches may be advised to follow the procedure as outlined in the [Annex.](#page-2-0) To sum up, the nodal/Focal Point branches will be required to prepare separate set of scrolls, one pertaining to March 2022 residual transactions and another for April transactions during the first 11 days of April 2022. The Nodal/Focal Point branches should also ensure that the accounts for all transactions (revenues/tax collections/payments) are effected at the receiving branches up to March 31, 2022 in the accounts for the current financial year itself and are not mixed up with the transactions of April 2022. Also, while reporting transactions

## **Reporting of March 2022 transactions**

<span id="page-2-0"></span>Beginning from April 1, 2022, the Nodal/Focal Point branches will segregate on a daily basis all scrolls/challans pertaining to March 2022 received from the receiving branches concerned and prepare separate main scrolls for:

- (a) scrolls for transactions of March 2022 or earlier period (i.e. effected during the previous financial year 2021-22) and
- (b) scrolls pertaining to current transactions (i.e. those effected from April 1, 2022 onwards).

2. The main scrolls for March 2022 transactions prepared from April 1 to April 11, 2022 are to be distinctly marked as March Residual – 1, March Residual – 2 and so on upto April 11, 2022. In other words, serial number should be allotted in consecutive order for each main scroll of March 2022 transactions sent from April 1 to April 11, 2022. These scrolls along with the copies of daily summary of Receipts and Payments prepared separately for March 2022 transactions will be forwarded to the Departmental Officials concerned (i.e. Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers and Designated Officers) in the usual way. The Nodal/Focal Point branches will also be required to report the above transactions to the Link Cell through separate Daily Memos. These advices must be sent to enable the Link Cell of each bank at Nagpur, to make daily settlement with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section (CAS) Nagpur. On receipt of advices from the Nodal/Focal Point branches, the Link Cell should segregate the advices for the March Residual transactions and forward them separately to Reserve Bank of India, CAS, Nagpur. This procedure should continue upto and inclusive of April 11, 2022 only. All transactions reported thereafter by the receiving branches will be reported and accounted for in the usual manner in the accounts of the month of report irrespective of the date of transaction. Following the special arrangements for March 2022 transactions, it is necessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets of DMS to be submitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for March 2022 transactions – one for transactions upto March 31, 2022 and another for March Residual transactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 11, 2022.
