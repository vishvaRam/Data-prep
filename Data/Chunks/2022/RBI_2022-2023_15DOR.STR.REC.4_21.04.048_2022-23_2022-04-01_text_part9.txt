passu* with base project loans and their repayment schedule is also the same as that of the base project loans.

4.2.15.5.2 Accordingly, in cases where banks have specifically sanctioned a 'standby facility' at the time of initial financial closure to fund cost overruns, they may fund cost overruns as per the agreed terms and conditions.

4.2.15.5.3 Where the initial financial closure does not envisage such financing of cost overruns, banks are allowed to fund cost overruns, which may arise on account of extension of DCCO up to two years and one year from the original DCCO stipulated at the time of financial closure for infrastructure projects and noninfrastructure projects (including commercial real estate projects) respectively, without treating the loans as 'restructured asset', subject to the following conditions:

a) Banks may fund additional 'Interest During Construction', which may arise on account of delay in completion of a project;

b) Other cost overruns (excluding Interest During Construction) up to a maximum of 10% of the original project cost;

c) The Debt Equity Ratio as agreed at the time of initial financial closure should remain unchanged subsequent to funding cost overruns or improve in favour of the lenders and the revised Debt Service Coverage Ratio should be acceptable to the lenders;

d) Disbursement of funds for cost overruns should start only after the Sponsors/Promoters bring in their share of funding of the cost overruns; and

e) All other terms and conditions of the loan should remain unchanged or enhanced in favour of the lenders.

4.2.15.5.4 The ceiling of 10 per cent of the original project cost prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15.5.3 (b) above is applicable to financing of all other cost overruns (excluding interest during construction), including cost overruns on account of fluctuations in the value of Indian Rupee against other currencies, arising out of extension of date of commencement of commercial operations.

## *4.2.15.6 Other Issues*

4.2.15.6.1 All other aspects of restructuring of project loans before commencement of commercial operations would be governed by the provisions of Parts B1 and B2 of this Master Circular. Restructuring of project loans after commencement of commercial operations will also be governed by these instructions.

4.2.15.6.2 Any change in the repayment schedule of a project loan caused due to an increase in the project outlay on account of increase in scope and size of the project, would not be treated as restructuring if:

a) The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before commencement of commercial operations of the existing project.

23

b) The rise in cost excluding any cost-overrun in respect of the original project is 25% or more of the original outlay.

c) The bank re-assesses the viability of the project before approving the enhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCO.

d) On re-rating, (if already rated) the new rating is not below the previous rating by more than one notch.

4.2.15.6.3 Multiple revisions of the DCCO and consequential shift in repayment schedule for equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) will be treated as a single event of restructuring provided that the revised DCCO is fixed within the respective time limits stipulated at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iv) above, and all other terms and conditions of the loan remained unchanged.

4.2.15.6.4 Banks, if deemed fit, may extend DCCO beyond the respective time limits stipulated at Paragraph 4.2.15.2(iv) above; however, in that case, banks will not be able to retain the 'standard' asset classification status of such loan accounts.

4.2.15.6.5 In all the above cases of restructuring where regulatory forbearance has been extended, the Boards of banks should satisfy themselves about the viability of the project and the restructuring plan.

## *4.2.15.7 Asset classification and Income recognition for projects under implementation relating to Deferment of DCCO and Cost Overruns*

4.2.15.7.1 In cases where DCCO is extended within the periods stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.2 and funding of cost overruns complies with the thresholds/conditions stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.5, such loans shall be treated as 'standard' in all respects.

4.2.15.7.2 In cases where DCCO is extended within the periods stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.2, but funding of cost overruns does not comply with the thresholds/conditions stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.5, such loans shall be treated as 'restructured standard' and attract a provision of 5 per cent from the date of such restructuring till the commencement of commercial operations or 2 years from the date of restructuring, whichever is later. These loans may be upgraded to 'standard' category once the entire project commences commercial operations.

4.2.15.7.3 In cases where DCCO is extended beyond the periods stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.15.2 (iii) but up to periods stipulated in Paragraph 4.2.
