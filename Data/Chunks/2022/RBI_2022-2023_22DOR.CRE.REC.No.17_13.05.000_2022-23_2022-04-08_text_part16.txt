e certificate of the Collector should be issued crop wise covering all crops, including food-grains. Issuing of such certificates in respect of cash crops, may, however, be left to the discretion of the Collector.

iii) To be effective, the assistance to farmers will have to be disbursed with utmost speed. For this purpose the lead bank and the district authorities concerned should evolve a procedure whereby identification of borrowers, issuance of certificates regarding Government / co-operative / bank dues, title of the applicant to land etc. is secured simultaneously.

iv) Possibilities of organising credit camps, where Block Development and Revenue officials, Cooperative Inspectors, Panchayat Pradhans etc. could help finalise the applications on the spot, could be explored in consultation with the district authorities where such credit camps are being organised. The State Government will also arrange with the Collectors to issue an executive order for the following officers or their authorised representatives to assume respective duties and responsibilities as envisaged under implementation of credit camps programme:

- Block Development Officer
- Co-operative Inspector
- Revenue Authority / Village Revenue Assistant
- Bank official operating in the area
- PACS / LAMPS / FSS
- Gram Panchayat Pradhan

In order to avoid delay, the forms in which the State Government Officers have to give certificates at the Credit Camps may be got printed in sufficient numbers by the respective District Magistrates.

v) In considering loan applications for the ensuing crop season the current dues of the applicants to the State Government may be ignored, provided the State Government declare a moratorium for a sufficiently long period on all amounts due to the government as on the date of occurrence of the natural calamity.

#### **11. Consumption Loans**

As per extant instructions, loans up to ₹250/- could be sanctioned to existing borrowers for general consumption purposes and the limit could be enhanced to ₹1,000/- in the States where the State Governments have constituted risk funds for such lending. The present limit may be enhanced to ₹5,000/ without any collateral and such loans may be provided even if no risk fund has been constituted.

## **12. Fresh Loans**

12. Timely fresh financial assistance to resume productive activities may be provided not only to the existing borrowers, but also to other eligible borrowers. Notwithstanding the status of the existing account, fresh loans granted to the borrowers will be treated as current dues.

## **13. Restructuring of existing Loans**

a. As the repaying capacity of the people affected by natural calamities gets severely impaired due to the damage to the economic pursuits and loss of economic assets, relief in repayment of loans becomes necessary in areas affected by natural calamity and hence, restructuring of the existing loans will be required. The principal amount outstanding in the crop loans and agriculture term loans as well as accrued interest thereon may be converted into term loans.

b. The repayment period of restructured term loans may vary depending on the severity of calamity and its recurrence, the extent of loss of economic assets and distress caused. Generally, the restructured period for repayment may be 3 to 5 years. However, where the damage arising out of the calamity is very severe, banks may, at their discretion, extend the period of repayment ranging up to 7 years and in extreme cases of hardship, the repayment period may be prolonged up to a maximum period of 10 years. In all cases of restructuring, moratorium period of at least one year should be considered. Further, the banks should not insist for additional collateral security for such restructured loans. The asset classification status of the restructured term loan and other dues will be as under:

c. The restructured crop loans may be treated as current dues and need not be classified as NPA. The asset classification of the restructured term loans would thereafter be governed by the revised terms and conditions and would be treated as NPA if interest and / or installment of principal remain overdue for two crop seasons for short duration crops and for one crop season for long duration crops. Depending upon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist, the above norms would also be made applicable to the restructured agricultural term loans.

d. The above norms will be applicable to all direct agricultural advances as listed at Annex I of [Master](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=3702)  [Circular No. UBD.PCB.MC.No.10/09.14.000/2007-08 dated July 4, 2007](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=3702) on prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to advances.

e. Additional finance, if any, may be treated as "standard asset" and its future asset classification will be governed by the ter
