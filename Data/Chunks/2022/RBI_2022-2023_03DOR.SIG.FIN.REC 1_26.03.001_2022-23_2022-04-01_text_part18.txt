estimated cash flows, uncertainty in realising expected cash flows in initial period, management, business risk, financial risk, etc.

(f) The Recovery Rating should reflect changes like change in resolution strategy of the ARC that take place from time to time.

(g) The Recovery Rating will factor in likely cash flows from the underlying impaired assets till the maturity of the SRs.

(h) The Recovery Rating should comprise of rating of not only the SRs of the scheme as a whole but wherever feasible a desegregation of each component in the scheme, which means the underlying assets of each entity in the scheme forming the basket should also be rated.

(i) The Rating Agency should disclose the rationale for rating on request.

#### **(vii) Methodology for valuation of SRs for declaration of NAV**

Each rating category in the recovery scale will have an associate **range** of recovery, expressed in percentage terms, which can be used for computing NAV of SRs. The NAV should be restricted within the recovery range associated with the rating assigned to the SRs. The ARC based on its recovery experience should choose a particular percentage within the recovery range indicated by the Rating Agency. The Recovery Rating percentage so picked by the ARC multiplied by the face value of the SR will give the NAV. The ARC should provide the rationale for selection of the particular percentage of Recovery Rating. For example, if range is between 81% - 90%, ARC may pick up 87% based on its judgement. The face value of say Rs 10 multiplied by the recovery percentage i.e. 87% would give the NAV as Rs 8.70].
