aken into account. Any reduction in capital funds, including by way of losses, during the aforesaid period shall also be considered.

### **Share linking to borrowing norms**

9. Borrowings from UCBs are linked to shareholdings of the borrowing members as below:

- i. 5 per cent of the borrowings, if the borrowings are on unsecured basis.
- ii. 2.5 per cent of the borrowings, in case of secured borrowings.
- iii. In case of secured borrowings by Micro and Small Enterprises (MSE), 2.5 per cent of the borrowings; of which 1 per cent is to be collected initially and the balance of 1.5 per cent is to be collected in the course of next 2 years.

10. The above share linking norm may be applicable for member's shareholdings up to the limit of 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank. Where a member is already holding 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of a UCB, it would not be necessary for him / her to subscribe to any additional share capital on account of the application of extant share linking norms. In other words, a borrowing member may be required to hold shares for an amount that may be computed as per the extant share linking norms or for an amount that is 5 per cent of the total paid up share capital of the bank, whichever is lower.

11. In terms of the extant norms[2](#page-2-1), UCBs which maintain CRAR of 12 per cent on a continuous basis, are exempted from the mandatory share linking norms outlined in para 9 above. On a review, it has been decided that the share-linking to borrowing norms shall be discretionary for UCBs which meet the minimum regulatory CRAR criteria of 9 per cent and a Tier 1 CRAR of 5.5 per cent as per the latest audited financial statements and the last CRAR as assessed by RBI during statutory inspection. Such UCBs shall have a Board-approved policy on sharelinking to borrowing norms, which shall be implemented in a transparent, consistent and nondiscriminatory manner. The policy may be reviewed by the Board at the beginning of the accounting year. UCBs which do not maintain the minimum CRAR of 9 percent and Tier 1
