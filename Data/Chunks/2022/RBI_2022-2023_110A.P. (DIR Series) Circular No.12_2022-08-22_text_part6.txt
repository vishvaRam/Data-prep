The allotment of UIN does not constitute an approval from the Reserve Bank for the investment made/to be made in the foreign entity. The issue of UIN only signifies taking on record of the investment for maintaining the database. Further, with effect from June 01, 2012, an auto generated e-mail giving the details of UIN allotted to the foreign entity is forwarded to the AD bank/Indian investor as confirmation of allotment of UIN, and no separate letter is issued by the Reserve Bank.

(4) A resident individual making overseas investment must comply with the reporting requirements as provided under the OI Regulations and reporting shall also be done as provided under the LRS where such investment is reckoned towards the LRS limit.
