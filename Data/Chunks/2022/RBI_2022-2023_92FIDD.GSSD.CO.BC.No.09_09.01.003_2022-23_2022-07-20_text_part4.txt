d to benefit from the thrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of Revolving Fund. However, as regards credit facilities, the group may be financed excluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. Banks should not deny loans to SHGs on the grounds of family members of individual members of SHG being defaulters with the bank. Further, nonwillful defaulters should not be debarred from receiving loans. In case default is due to genuine reasons, banks may follow the norms prescribed for restructuring the credit facilities.

# **7.3.8 Documentation and follow- up**

- (i) Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to the SHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms and conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated with every transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of loan, banks may clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.
- (ii) Bank branches may designate one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go to the field and attend the meetings of theSHGs and Federations to observe the operations of the SHGs, keep a track of the regularity of the SHGs' meetings and monitor their performance.

## **8 Recovery:**

Prompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall take all possible measures, such as personal contact and organization of joint recovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DMMUs)/District Rural Development Agency (DRDAs) to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY-NRLM every month and furnish the list in the Block Level Bankers Committee (BLBC) and District Consultative Committee (DCC) meetings. This would enable the DAY-NRLM staff at the block/district level to assist the bankers in initiating recovery.

#### **9 Credit Target Planning and Monitoring of the Scheme**

- (i) Banks may set up cells for Self Help Groups in their respective Regional/Zonal offices. These cells should periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the Scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data to the Head Office and the DAY-NRLM units at the districts/blocks. The consolidated data may also be discussed in the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC), BLBC and DCC meetings regularly to maintain effective communication with the state staff and all banks.
- (ii) State Level Bankers' Committee: SLBCs shall constitute a sub-committee on SHG bank linkage. The sub-committee should consist of members from all banks operating in the State, RBI, NABARD, CEO of SRLM, representatives of State Rural Development Department, Secretary-Institutional Finance and representatives of Development Departments etc. Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, the SLBC sub-committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the districtwise, block-wise and branch-wise credit plan. The sub-committee should consider the existing SHGs, new SHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation. The sub-committee shall discuss a specific agenda of review, implementation and monitoring of the SHG-Bank linkage and the issues/constraints in achievement of the credit target. The decisions of the SLBC should be derived from the analysis of the reports of the sub-committee.
- (iii) The district-wise credit plans should be communicated to the District Consultative Committee (DCC). The block- wise/cluster-wise targets are to be communicated to the bank branches through the Controllers**.**
- (iv) District Consultative Committee: The DCC shall regularly monitor the flow of credit to SHGs at the district level and resolve issues that constrain such flow of credit. This

committee should include DMMU staff representing DAY-NRLM and office bearers of SHG federations in addition to other members.

- (v) Block Level Bankers Committee: The BLBC shall take up issues of SHG bank linkage at the block level. In this Committee, the SHGs/Federations of the SHGs should be included as members to raise their voice in the forum. Branch-wise status of SHG credit shall be monitored at the BLBC.
- (vi) Reporting to Lead District Managers: The branches may furnish the progress report and the delinquency report under various activities of DAY-NRLM in the format at [Annexâ€“III](#page--1-0) and [IV](#page--1-1) to the LDM every month for onward submission to Special Sub-Committee constituted by SLBC.
- (vii) Reporting to RBI: Banks may furnish a state-wise consolidated report on the progress made under DAY-NRLM
