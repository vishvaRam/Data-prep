the paid up equity capital of stake in the acquired project. If the new promoter is a non-resident, and in sectors where the ceiling on foreign investment is less than 51 per cent, the new promoter should own at least 26 per cent of the paid up equity capital or up to applicable foreign investment limit, whichever is higher, provided banks are satisfied that with this equity stake the new non-resident promoter controls the management of the project;

d) Viability of the project should be established to the satisfaction of the banks.

e) Intra-group business restructuring/mergers/acquisitions and/or takeover/acquisition of the project by other entities/subsidiaries/associates etc. (domestic as well as overseas), belonging to the existing promoter/promoter group will not qualify for this facility. The banks should clearly establish that the acquirer does not belong to the existing promoter group;

f) Asset classification of the account as on the 'reference date' would continue during the extended period. For this purpose, the 'reference date' would be the date of execution of preliminary binding agreement between the parties to the transaction, provided that the acquisition/takeover of ownership as per the provisions of law/regulations governing such acquisition/takeover is completed within a period of 90 days from the date of execution of preliminary binding agreement. During the intervening period, the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply. If the change in ownership is not completed within 90 days from the preliminary binding agreement, the 'reference date' would be the effective date of acquisition/takeover as per the provisions of law/regulations governing such acquisition/takeover;

g) The new owners/promoters are expected to demonstrate their commitment by bringing in substantial portion of additional monies required to complete the project within the extended time period. As such, treatment of financing of cost overruns for the project shall be subject to the guidelines prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 of this circular. Financing of cost overrun beyond the ceiling prescribed in Paragraph 4.2.15.5 of this circular would be treated as an event of restructuring even if the extension of DCCO is within the limits prescribed above;

h) While considering the extension of DCCO (up to an additional period of 2 years) for the benefits envisaged hereinabove, banks shall make sure that the repayment schedule does not extend beyond 85 per cent of the economic life/concession period of the project; and

i) This facility would be available to a project only once before achievement of DCCO and will not be available during subsequent change in ownership, if any.

4.2.15.3.4 Loans covered under this guideline would attract provisioning as per the extant provisioning norms depending upon their asset classification status.

## *4.2.15.4 Deemed DCCO*

4.2.15.4.1 A project with multiple independent units may be deemed to have commenced commercial operations from the date when the independent units representing 50 per cent (or higher) of the originally envisaged capacity have commenced commercial production of the final output as originally envisaged, subject to the following conditions:

21

- a. The units representing remaining 50 per cent (or lower) of the originally envisaged capacity shall commence commercial operations within a maximum period of one year from the deemed date of commencement of commercial operations;
- b. Commercial viability of the project is reassessed beyond doubt; and
- c. Capitalisation of interest obligation in respect of project debt component attributable to the units of the plant which have commenced commercial operations has to cease and the revenue expenditure is booked under revenue account.

4.2.15.4.2 In such cases, banks may, at their discretion, also effect a consequential shift in repayment schedule of the debt attributable to units which have not commenced commercial operations for equal or shorter duration (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) i.e., one year, subject to no other changes being carried out.

4.2.15.4.3 If the remaining units do not commence commercial operations within the stipulated time of one year at paragraph 4.2.15.4.1 (a) above, the account shall be treated as non-performing asset and the provisions shall be made accordingly.

## *4.2.15.5 Financing of Cost Overruns for Projects under Implementation*

4.2.15.5.1 Internationally, project finance lenders sanction a 'standby credit facility' to fund cost overruns if needed. Such 'standby credit facilities' are sanctioned at the time of initial financial closure; but disbursed only when there is a cost overrun. At the time of credit assessment of borrowers/project, such cost overruns are also taken into account while determining the project Debt Equity Ratio, Debt Service Coverage Ratio, Fixed Asset Coverage Ratio etc. Such 'standby credit facilities' rank *pari
