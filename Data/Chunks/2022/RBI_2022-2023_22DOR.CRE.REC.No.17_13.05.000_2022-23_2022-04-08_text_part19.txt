wed time to build up margin gradually from his future cash generation. Wherever State Government or any agency has formulated special scheme for providing grants / subsidy / seed money, suitable margin may be stipulated to the extent of such grants / subsidy / seed money.

iv) The primary consideration before the banks in extending credit to a small / tiny unit for its rehabilitation should be the viability of the venture after the rehabilitation programme is implemented.

#### **20. Terms and Conditions**

The terms and conditions governing relief loans will be flexible as to security, margin, etc. In the case of small loans covered by guarantee of Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation, personal guarantees will not be insisted upon. In any case, credit should not be denied for want of personal guarantees.

#### **21. Security**

Where the bank's existing security has been eroded because of damage or destruction by floods, assistance will not be denied merely for want of additional fresh security. The fresh loan may be granted even if the value of security (existing as well as the asset to be acquired from the new loan) is less than the loan amount. For fresh loans sympathetic view will have to be taken :

a) Where the crop loan (which has been converted into term loan) was earlier given against personal security / hypothecation of crop which would be the case for crop loans upto ₹5,000/- and the borrower is not able to offer charge / mortgage of land as security for the converted loan, he should not be denied conversion facility merely on the ground of his inability to furnish land as security.

b) If the borrower has already taken a term loan against mortgage / charge on land, the bank should be content with a second charge for the converted term loan.

c) Banks should not insist on third party guarantees for providing conversion facilities.

d) In the case of term loans for replacement of equipment, repairs, etc. and for working capital finance to artisans and self-employed persons or for crop loans, usual security may be obtained. Where land is taken as security in the absence of original Title Records, a Certificate issued by the Revenue Department Officials may be accepted for financing farmers who have lost proof of their titles i.e. in the form of deeds, as also the registration certificates issued to registered share-croppers.

e) As per the recommendations of the Reserve Bank of India's report on Customer Service, banks will finance the borrowers who require loans upto ₹500/- without insisting either on collateral security or guarantee for any type of economic activity.

#### **22. Margin**

Margin requirements be waived or the grants / subsidy given by the concerned State Government may be considered as margin.

#### **23. Interest**

The rates of interest will be in accordance with the directives of the Reserve Bank of India. Within the areas of their discretion, however, banks are expected to take a sympathetic view of the difficulties of the borrowers and extend a concessional treatment to calamity-affected people.

i) Those meeting the eligibility criteria under the scheme of Differential Rate of Interest should be provided credit in accordance with the provision of the scheme.

ii) In respect of current dues in default, no penal interest will be charged. The banks should also suitably defer the compounding of interest charges.

# **24. Other Issues**

# **i) Business Continuity Planning**

In the backdrop of increased leveraging of technology in banking system, Business Continuity Planning (BCP) has become a key pre-requisite for minimizing business disruption and system failures. As a Business Continuity Planning (BCP) strategy, banks may identify alternate branches for branches located in areas prone to natural calamities. Banks may therefore formulate full-fledged comprehensive BCP along with Disaster-Recovery (DR) arrangements. The banks may also focus on keeping the DR site current, to test them comprehensively and synchronize the data between the primary and secondary sites.

# **ii) Access to Customers to their Bank Accounts**

a) In areas where the bank branches are affected by natural calamity and are unable to function normally, banks may operate from temporary premises, under advice to Reserve Bank of India. For continuing the temporary premises beyond 30 days, specific approval may be obtained from the Regional Office (RO) concerned of Reserve Bank of India. Banks may also ensure rendering of banking services to the affected areas by setting up satellite offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities under intimation to RO of Reserve Bank of India.

b) To satisfy customer's immediate cash requirements, banks could consider waiving the penalties related to accessing accounts such as fixed deposits

c) Restoration of the functioning of ATMs at the earliest or making alternate arrangements for providing such facilities may be given due importance. Banks may co
