(4) It is provided with respect to financial commitment by way of Guarantee [regulation 5 of OI Regulations] that-

- a) In the case of performance guarantee, time specified for the completion of the contract shall be treated as its validity period.
- b) No prior approval from the Reserve Bank shall be needed for remitting the funds from India on account of invocation of a performance guarantee extended in accordance with OI Rules/Regulations.
- c) Any guarantee, to the extent of the amount invoked, shall cease to be a part of the nonfund based financial commitment but will be considered as financial commitment by way of debt. Such invocation shall be reported in Form FC.
- d) Roll-over of guarantee shall not be treated as fresh financial commitment. However, such roll-over shall be reported in Form FC.
- e) A group company of the Indian entity may extend a guarantee in accordance with the OI Regulations if such group company is eligible to make ODI as per the OI Rules and such guarantee shall be counted towards the utilisation of the financial commitment limit of such

In case of a resident individual promoter, the same shall be counted towards the financial commitment limit of the Indian entity and accordingly be reported by the Indian entity. The concept of utilising the net worth of the subsidiary/holding company by the Indian entity has been discontinued henceforth. Further, for computing the financial commitment limit of the group company, any fund-based exposure of such group company to the Indian entity or of the Indian entity to such group company, as the case may be, shall be deducted from the net worth of such group company.
