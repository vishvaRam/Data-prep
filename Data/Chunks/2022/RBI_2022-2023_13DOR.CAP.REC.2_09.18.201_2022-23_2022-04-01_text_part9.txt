	- a) The call option on the instrument is permissible after the instrument has run for at least ten years; and

### **2.5 Classification**

PDI shall be classified as 'Borrowings' and shown separately in the Balance Sheet.

- i. the bank's CRAR is below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI; or
- ii. the impact of such payment results in bank's CRAR falling below or remaining below the minimum regulatory requirement prescribed by RBI;

2.7.2 However, UCBs may pay interest with the prior approval of the DoR, RBI when the impact of such payment may result in net loss or increase the net loss, provided the CRAR meets the regulatory norm.

# **2.11 Compliance with Reserve Requirements**

The total amount raised by a UCB through the issue of PDI shall not be reckoned as liability for calculation of net demand and time liabilities for the purpose of reserve requirements and, as such, will not attract CRR / SLR requirements.
