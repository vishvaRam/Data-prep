 the wilful defaulters:

(a) No additional facilities be granted to the listed wilful defaulters. In addition, the entrepreneurs / promoters of companies where banks have identified siphoning / diversion of funds, misrepresentation, falsification of accounts and fraudulent transactions should be debarred from institutional finance for floating new ventures for a period of 5 years from the date the name of the wilful defaulter is published in the list of wilful defaulters by the Reserve Bank of India.

(b) The legal process, where warranted, against the borrowers / guarantors and foreclosure of loans should be initiated expeditiously. The lenders may also initiate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters, wherever necessary

(c) Wherever possible, the banks should adopt a proactive approach for a change of Management of the wilfully defaulting borrower unit. It would be imperative on the part of the banks to put in place a transparent mechanism for the entire process so that the penal provisions are not misused and the scope of such discretionary powers is kept to the barest minimum. It should be ensured that a solitary or isolated instance is not made the basis for imposing penal measures.

5.4.5 **Treatment of Group:** While dealing with wilful default of a single borrowing company in a group, the banks should consider the track record of the individual company, with reference to its repayment performance to its lenders. However, in cases where a letter of comfort and / or the guarantees furnished by the companies within the group on behalf of the wilfully defaulting units are not honoured when invoked by scheduled banks, such group companies should also be reckoned as wilful defaulters.

5.4.6 **Role of Auditors:** In case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by banks, they should lodge a formal complaint against the auditors of the borrowers, with Institute of Chartered Accountant of India (ICAI) if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or deficient in conducting the audit to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors.

With a view to monitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific certification from borrowers' auditors regarding diversion / siphoning of funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to the auditors for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors scheduled UCBs will also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan agreements are incorporated to enable award of such a mandate by the lenders to the borrowers / auditors.

5.4.7 **Filing of Suits to Recover Dues from Wilful Defaulters :** Scheduled UCBs should examine all cases of wilful defaults of ₹1.00 crore and above and file suits in such cases UCBs should also examine whether in such cases of wilful defaults, there are instances of cheating / fraud by the defaulting borrowers and if so, they should also file criminal cases against those borrowers. In other cases involving amounts below ₹1.00 crore, banks should take appropriate action, including legal action, against the defaulting borrowers.

## **6. Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances**

**6.1. General Principles** The basic objective of restructuring is to preserve economic value of units and not evergreening of problem accounts. This can be achieved by banks and the borrowers by careful assessment of the viability, quick detection of weaknesses in accounts and a time-bound implementation of restructuring packages. The prudential guidelines will be applicable to all categories of debt restructuring other than those restructured on account of natural calamities, which will continue to be governed by the extant guidelines. The principles and prudential norms laid down are applicable to all advances, including borrowers who are eligible for special regulatory treatment for asset classification as detailed in the prudential guideline on restructuring of advances at para 2.2.7 of Master Circular - Income Recognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and Other Related Matters – UCBs dated April 1, 2021, as amended from time to time. The revised definition of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises has been given in [Annex 4](#page--1-0)[1](#page-1-0).

## **6.2. Eligibility Criteria for Restructuring of Advances**

6.2.1. Banks may restructure the accounts classified under 'standard', 'sub-standard' and 'doubtful' categories.

6.2.2 Banks cannot reschedule / restructure / renegotiate borrowal accounts with retrospective effect. While a restructuring proposal is under consideration, the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply. The process of re-classification of an asset should not stop merely because restructuring proposal is under consideration. The asset classification status as on the date of approval of the restructured package by the competent authority would be relevant to decide the asset classification
