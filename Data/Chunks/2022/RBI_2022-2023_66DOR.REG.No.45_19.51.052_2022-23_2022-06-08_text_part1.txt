Madam / Dear Sir

# **Section 23 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 – Doorstep Banking**

In terms of Section 23 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) are required to seek prior approval of the Reserve Bank for opening any new place of business including offering services at the doorstep of the customer.

2. Keeping in view the above, it has been decided to allow financially sound and well managed (FSWM) UCBs to provide Doorstep Banking Services to their customers on a voluntary basis. However, Non-FSWM UCBs would have to seek prior approval of concerned Regional Office of Department of Supervision of the Reserve Bank to provide Doorstep Banking Services.

3. Eligible UCBs may formulate a scheme for providing Doorstep Banking Services to their customers, with the approval of their Boards, in accordance with the guidelines [enclosed](#page-2-0) to this letter.

4. UCBs are further advised to take into account the various risks that may arise on account of offering Doorstep Banking Services to customers either directly through own employees or through agents and take all necessary steps to manage the same.

## **Guidelines for Doorstep Banking by UCBs**

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>**1. Services to be offered**

UCBs can voluntarily offer the following banking services to individual customers/ natural persons at their doorstep: -

- i. Pick up of cash against receipt;
- ii. Pick up of instruments against receipt;
- iii. Delivery of demand drafts against withdrawal from account;
- iv. Delivery of cash against withdrawal from account either against cheque received at the counter or request received through any secured convenient channel, such as phone banking, internet banking, etc;
- v. Submission of Know Your Customer (KYC) documents;
- vi. Submission of Life Certificate.

UCBs which offer services of pick-up of cash may take suitable steps to educate their employees and agents to enable them to detect forged and mutilated notes so as to avoid frauds and disputes with customers.

#### **2. Mode of Delivery**

- i. Through own employees
- ii. Through Agents

Where UCBs engage the services of Agents for delivery of services, it should be ensured that the policy approved by the Board lays down the broad principles for selection of Agents and payment of fee/commission etc. UCBs must refer to the guidelines on Managing Risks in Outsourcing of Financial Services by co-operative banks issued vide our [circular DoR.ORG.REC.27/21.04.158/2021-22](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12123&Mode=0) dated June 28, 2021 and ensure that the principles enumerated therein are complied with while offering Doorstep Banking Services.

### **3. Delivery process**

- i. Cash collected from the customer should be acknowledged by issuing a receipt on behalf of the UCB;
- ii. Cash collected from the customer should be credited to the customer's account on the same day or next working day, depending on the time of collection;
- iii. At the time of collection of cash, the customer should be informed of the date of credit by issuing a suitable advice;
- iv. Delivery of demand draft should be done by debit to the account on the basis of requisition in writing/ cheque received and not against cash or instruments collected at the doorstep;
- v. Acknowledgment should be provided for collection of KYC documents, Life Certificate.

#### **4. Risk Management**

It may be ensured that the agreement entered into with the customer does not entail any legal or financial liability on the bank for failure to offer doorstep services under circumstances beyond its control. The services should be seen as a mere extension of banking services offered at the branch and the liability of the bank should be the same as if the transactions were conducted at the branch. The agreement should not provide any right to the customer to claim the services at his doorstep.
