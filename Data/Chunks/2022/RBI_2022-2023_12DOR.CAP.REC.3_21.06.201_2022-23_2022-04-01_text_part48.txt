cluded in the (reference/ deliverable) obligations in the CDS documentation.

(c) In each of the cases in paragraph (a) and (b) above, rather than applying specific risk capital requirements on each side of the transaction (i.e., the credit protection and the underlying asset), only higher of the two capital requirements will apply.

# **8.6.2.2 Specific Risk Charge in CDS Positions which are not meant for Hedging**

In cases not captured in paragraph 8.6.2.1, a specific risk capital charge will be assessed against both sides of the positions.

## **8.6.3 Capital Charge for Counterparty Credit Risk**

The credit exposure for the purpose of counterparty credit risk on account of CDS transactions in the Trading Book will be calculated according to the Current Exposure Method<sup>87</sup> .

#### **8.6.3.1 Protection Seller**

A protection seller will have exposure to the protection buyer only if the fee/premia is outstanding. In such cases, the counterparty credit risk charge for all single name long CDS positions in the Trading Book will be calculated as the sum of the current marked-to-market value, if positive (zero, if marked-to-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add-on factors based on table given below. However, the add-on will be capped to the amount of unpaid premia.


#### **8.6.3.2 Protection Buyer**

A CDS contract creates a counterparty exposure on the protection seller on account of the credit event payment. The counterparty credit risk charge for all short CDS positions in the Trading Book

<sup>87</sup> A CDS contract, which is required to be marked-to-market, creates bilateral exposure for the parties to the contract. The mark-to-market value of a CDS contract is the difference between the default-adjusted present value of protection payment (called "protection leg" / "credit leg") and the present value of premium payable called ("premium leg"). If the value of credit leg is less than the value of the premium leg, then the marked-to-market value for the protection seller in positive. Therefore, the protection seller will have exposure to the counterparty (protection buyer) if the value of premium leg is more than the value of credit leg. In case, no premium is outstanding, the value of premium leg will be zero and the mark-to-market value of the CDS contract will always be negative for the protection seller and therefore, protection seller will not have any exposure to the protection buyer. In no case, the protection seller's exposure on protection buyer can exceed the amount of the premium unpaid. For the purpose of capital adequacy as well as exposure norms, the measure of counterparty exposures in case of CDS transaction held in Trading Book is the Potential Future Exposure (PFE) which is measured and recognised as per Current Exposure Method.

will be calculated as the sum of the current marked-to-market value, if positive (zero, if markedto-market value is negative) and the potential future exposure add-on factors based on table given below:


## **8.6.3.3 Capital Charge for Counterparty Risk for Collateralised Transactions in CDS**

As mentioned in paragraph 3.3 of the [circular IDMD.PCD.No.5053/14.03.04/2010-11 dated May](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6432&Mode=0)  [23, 2011,](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6432&Mode=0) collaterals and margins would be maintained by the individual market participants. The counterparty exposure for CDS traded in the OTC market will be calculated as per the Current Exposure Method. Under this method, the calculation of the counterparty credit risk charge for an individual contract, taking into account the collateral, will be as follows:

Counterparty risk capital charge = [(RC + add-on) – CA] x r x 9%

Where;

RC = the replacement cost,

add-on = the amount for potential future exposure calculated according to paragraph 5.15.3.5 above.

CA = the volatility adjusted amount of eligible collateral under the comprehensive approach prescribed in paragraph 7.3 on "Credit Risk Mitigation Techniques - Collateralised Transactions" of these directions, or zero if no eligible collateral is applied to the transaction, and

r = the risk weight of the counterparty.

# **8.6.4 Treatment of Exposures below Materiality Thresholds of CDS**

Materiality thresholds on payments below which no payment is made in the event of loss are equivalent to retained first loss positions and should be assigned risk weight of 1250 per cent for capital adequacy purpose by the protection buyer.

# **8.7 Aggregation of the capital charge for Market Risks**

As explained earlier capital charges for specific risk and general market risk are to be computed separately before aggregation. For computing the total capital charge and Risk Weighted Assets for market risks, the calculations may be plotted in the following table:
