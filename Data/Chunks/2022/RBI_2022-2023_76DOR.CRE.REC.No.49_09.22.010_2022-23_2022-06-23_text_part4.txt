ks could perhaps enter into a tripartite agreement with the borrower and his clients, particularly when no collateral securities are available for such advances.

7.6 It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing Loan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g. upfront disbursal of sanctioned individual housing loans to builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of construction of housing project, interest / EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period / specified period, etc. In view of the higher risks associated with such lump-sum disbursal of sanctioned housing loans and customer suitability issues, UCBs are advised that disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / underconstruction / green field housing projects.

# **8. Housing Loans under Priority Sector**

**8.1** Instructions on loans to Housing sector eligible for priority sector classification shall be as per [Master Directions – Priority Sector Lending \(PSL\) – Targets and](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959)  [Classification FIDD.CO.Plan.BC.5/04.09.01/2020-21 dated September 4, 2020,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) as amended from time to time.

#### **9. Precautions**

9.1 A number of cases have come to the notice of Reserve Bank, where unscrupulous persons have defrauded the banks by obtaining multiple bank finance against the same property by preparing a number of sets of the original documents and submitting the same to various banks for obtaining housing finance. Similarly, the salary certificates of employees of certain public sector undertakings were fabricated, so as to match the requirement of banks for availing higher amounts of loan. The estimates given were also on the higher side, so as to avoid contribution of margin money by the borrowers.

Such frauds could take place on account of laxity on the part of the bank officials to follow the laid down procedures for verifying the genuineness of the documents submitted by borrowers independently through their own advocates / solicitors. Banks should, therefore, take due precaution while accepting various documents.

9.2 Banks shall satisfy themselves that loans extended by them are not for unauthorized construction or for misuse of properties / encroachment on public land. For this purpose, they should ensure strict compliance with the procedure laid down in [Annex 2.](#page--1-0)

9.3 In a case which came up before the Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Bombay, the Hon'ble Court observed that the bank granting finance to housing / development projects should insist on disclosure of the charge / or any other liability on the plot, in the brochure, pamphlets etc., which may be published by developer / owner inviting public at large to purchase flats and properties. The Court also added that this obviously would be part of the terms and conditions on which the loan may be sanctioned by the bank. Keeping in view the above observations, while granting finance for eligible housing schemes, UCBs are advised to stipulate as part of terms and conditions that:

(a) The builder / developer shall disclose in the pamphlets / brochures etc., the name(s) of the bank(s) to which the property is mortgaged.

(b) The builder / developer would append the information relating to mortgage while advertising for a particular scheme in newspapers / magazines etc.

(c) The builder / developer would indicate in the pamphlets / brochures that he would provide No Objection Certificate (NOC) / permission of the mortgagee bank for sale of flats / property, if required. UCBs are advised to ensure compliance of the above terms and conditions. Funds should not be released unless the builder / developer fulfils the above requirements.

# **10. National Building Code**

The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) formulates comprehensive building Code namely National Building Code (NBC) of India providing guidelines for regulating the building construction activities across the country. The Code, updated from time to time contains all the important aspects relevant to safe and orderly building development such as administrative regulations, development control rules and general building requirements; fire safety requirements; stipulations regarding materials, structural design and construction (including safety); and building and plumbing services. Adherence to NBC will be advisable in view of the importance of safety of buildings especially against natural disasters. Banks' boards may consider this aspect for incorporation in their loan policies. Further information regarding the NBC can be accessed from the website of Bureau of Indian Standards [\(http://www.bis
