classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.

# **5. Additional / Supplementary Finance**

5.1 UCBs may extend additional finance to carry out alterations, additions, repairs to houses / flats already financed by them, subject to, repayment capacity of borrowers.

5.2 In the case of individuals who might have raised funds for construction / acquisition of accommodation from other sources and need supplementary finance, banks may extend credit after obtaining *pari passu* or second mortgage charge over the property mortgaged in favour of other lenders and / or against such other security as they may deem appropriate after due assessment of aggregate repayment capacity of borrowers.

5.3 UCBs may extend need-based credit up to a maximum of ₹10 lakh in metropolitan centres and up to ₹6 lakh in other centres for repairs/additions/alterations, irrespective of whether the house / flat is owner occupied or tenant occupied, after obtaining such security as the banks may deem appropriate. The banks shall satisfy themselves regarding the estimated cost of repairs, additions, etc. having regard to the extent of such repairs or additions, materials to be used, cost of labour and other charges and after obtaining certificate/s from qualified engineers / architects in respect thereof, considered necessary.

5.4 The terms and conditions relating to margin, interest rates, repayment period etc. in respect of additional / supplementary finance may be same as indicated in respect of loans for construction / acquisition.

# **6. Lending to Housing Boards**

6.1 UCBs may extend loans to housing boards within their States. The rate of interest to be charged on the loans to such boards may be fixed at the discretion of the banks.

6.2 While extending loans to housing boards, banks may not only keep in view the past performance of the housing boards in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but should also stipulate that the boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan instalments from the beneficiaries.

# **7. Advances to Builders / Contractors**

7.1 Builders / contractors generally require huge funds, take advance payments from the prospective buyers or from those on whose behalf construction is undertaken and, therefore, may not normally require bank finance for the purpose. Any financial assistance extended to them by primary (urban) co-operative banks may result in dual financing. Banks should, therefore, normally refrain from sanctioning loans and advances to this category of borrowers.

7.2 However, where contractors undertake comparatively small construction work on their own, (i.e. when no advance payments are received by them for the purpose), banks may consider extending financial assistance to them against the hypothecation of construction materials, provided such loans and advances are in accordance with the bye laws of the bank and instructions / directives issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time.

7.3 Banks should undertake a proper scrutiny of the relevant loan applications, and satisfy themselves, among other things, about the genuineness of the purpose, the quantum of financial assistance required, creditworthiness of the borrower, repayment capacity, etc. and also observe the usual safeguards, such as, obtaining periodic stock statements, carrying out periodic inspections, determining drawing power strictly on the basis of the stock held, maintaining a margin of not less than 40 to 50 percent, etc. They should also ensure that materials used up in the construction work are not included in the stock statements for the purpose of determining the drawing power.

**7.4 Valuation of land:** It has been observed that while financing builders / contractors, certain banks valued the land for the purpose of security, on the basis of the discounted value of the property after it is developed, less the cost of development. This is not in conformity with established norms. In this connection, it is clarified that UCBs should not extend fund based / non-fund based facilities to builders / contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a housing project. Further, wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.

7.5 UCBs may also take collateral security, wherever available. As construction work progresses, contractors will get paid and such payments should be applied to reduce the balance in the borrowal accounts. If possible, ban
