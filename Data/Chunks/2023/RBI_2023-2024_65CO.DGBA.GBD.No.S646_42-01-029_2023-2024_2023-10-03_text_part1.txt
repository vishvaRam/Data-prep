All Agency Banks

Madam/Dear Sir,

## **Status of March 31, 2024 for Government transactions through integration with e-Kuber**

The 'e-Kuber' which is the Core Banking Solution platform of RBI for Government and other payments does not process any Government transactions on Global holidays (which are 26th January, 15th August, 2nd October, all 2nd and 4th Saturdays of a month and on all Sundays). It is observed that March 31, 2024 falls on a Sunday. The office of Controller General of Accounts, Government of India has advised that in order to account for all the Government transactions relating to receipts and payments in the financial year 2023-24 itself, it has been decided that March 31, 2024 (Sunday) be marked as a working day for the Government transactions so that all the Government transactions through integration with e-Kuber are processed on March 31, 2024 and accounted for in the financial year 2023-24 itself for arriving the cash balance of Government of India as on March 31, 2024.

2. Also, the luggage files from banks for transferring the data related to Government transactions to RBI would also be accepted by e-Kuber system on March 31, 2024 for accounting of the same in the account for the financial year 2023-24.

Yours faithfully
