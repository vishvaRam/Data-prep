Dear Sir / Madam

## **Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) Framework for Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) â€“ Extension to Government NBFCs**

Reserve Bank of India introduced [PCA Framework for NBFCs](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12208&Mode=0) on December 14, 2021. The Framework has since been reviewed and it has been decided to extend the same to Government NBFCs (except those in Base Layer) with effect from October 1, 2024, based on the audited financials of the NBFC as on March 31, 2024, or thereafter.

Yours faithfully,
