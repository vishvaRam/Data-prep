tion. Following the special arrangements for March 2023 transactions, it is necessary for the Nodal/Focal Point branches to prepare two sets of DMS to be submitted to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers for March 2023 transactions â€“ one for transactions upto March 31, 2023 and another for March Residual transactions adjusted by Nodal/Focal Point branches with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section, Nagpur, during April 1 to April 10, 2023.

3. Since the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2023 transactions pertaining to year 2023-24 in addition to March 2023 residual transactions, monthly statement for April 2023 transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2023 (financial year 2023-24) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as "March Residual Account". The statement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent by all Focal Point Branches to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers latest by April 18, 2023.

Note: As advised in our Circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995-96 dated May 22, 1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2023 should be treated as transactions relating to the current financial year as "March 2023 or March Residual Transactions", the reporting of which may take place during the month of April (upto April 10, 2023). But if any cheque is tendered on or before March 31, 2023 and realised on or after April 1, 2023, it will be treated as transaction for the next financial year as "April Transactions". Accordingly, the banks will prepare separate scrolls for March 2023 and April 2023 (Financial year 2023-24) transactions.
