- c) Also, in case contribution has been made by any UCB towards the above PSL shortfall during the FY 2020-21 and/ or FY 2021-22, that contribution can be used to offset any shortfall that may have occurred during FY 2022-23. Excess deposit, if any, after offsetting the PSL shortfall during FY 2022-23 will be refunded.
