cepted becomes an independent document. The special rules applicable to commercial credits do not apply to such a bill and the bill is exclusively governed by the law relating to Bills of Exchange, i.e. the Negotiable Instruments Act. The negotiating bank of such a bill is not under any obligation to check the particulars of the bill with reference to the terms of the L/C. This practice is, therefore, superfluous and defeats the purpose of issuing the L/C. The discounting banks should first ascertain from the co-accepting banks, the reason for such co-acceptance of bills drawn under their own L/C and only after satisfying themselves of genuineness of such transactions, they may consider discounting such bills.
- **2.6.2.4** It should be ensured that the branch officials strictly adhere to the above referred instructions at the time of co-acceptance of bills. It would be advisable to determine clear accountability in this respect and officials found to be not complying with the instructions must be dealt with sternly.

# **2.7 Precautions to be taken in the case of Letter of Credit**

**2.7.1** In the case of LCs for import of goods, banks should be very vigilant while making payment to the overseas suppliers on the basis of shipping documents. They should exercise precaution and care in comparing the clients. The payments should be released to the foreign parties only after ensuing that the documents are strictly in conformity with the terms of the LCs. There have been many irregularities in the conduct of LC business, such as the LC transactions not being recorded in the books of the branch by officials issuing them, the amount of LCs being much in excess of the powers vested in the officials, fraudulent issue of LCs involving a conspiracy/collusion between the beneficiary and the constituent. In such cases, the banks should take action against the concerned officials as well as the constituent on whose behalf the LCs were opened and the beneficiary of LCs, if a criminal conspiracy is involved.

## **2.7.2 Settlement of claims under Letter of Credits**

In case the bills drawn under LCs are not honoured, it would adversely affect the character of LCs and the relative bills as an accepted means of payment. This could also affect the credibility of the entire payment mechanism through banks and affect the image of the banks. Banks should, therefore, honour their commitments under LCs and make payments promptly.

## **2.8 Compliance to the regulations of Foreign Exchange Management Act, 2000**

Banks should note to comply with the directions, regulations issued under Foreign Exchange Management (Guarantee) Regulations, 2000 as amended from time to time.

### **2.9 Compliance to the Prudential Norms**

Banks shall comply with all the related prudential norms issued by RBI as amended from time to time.
