ut of them. DAY-NRLM would ensure adequate coverage of vulnerable sections of the society such that 50% of the beneficiaries are SC/STs, 15% are minorities and 3% are persons with disability, while keeping in view the ultimate target of 100% coverage of all households under the automatically included criteria and households with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC).

**2. Participatory Identification of poor (PIP):** The experience from SGSY suggests that the current BPL list has large inclusion and exclusion errors. To widen the target groups beyond the BPL list and to include all the needy poor identified as households with at least one deprivation criteria as per Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC). DAY- NRLM would also undertake community-based process i.e. participation of the poor in the process of identifying the target group. Participatory process based on sound methodology and tools *(social mapping and well-being categorization, deprivation indicators)* and also locally understood and accepted criterion ensures local consensus that inadvertently reduces the inclusion and exclusion errors and enables formation of the groups on the basis of mutual affinity. Over the years, the participatory method of identifying the poor have been developed and applied successfully in the states like AP, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha.

The households identified with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC along with households identified through the P.I.P process would be accepted as DAY-NRLM target group and would be eligible for all the benefits under the programme. The list finalized after PIP process would be vetted by the Gram Sabha and approved by the Gram Panchayat.

Till the PIP process is undertaken by the State in a particular district/Block, the rural households with at least one deprivation criteria as per SECC list would be targeted under DAY-NRLM. As already provided in the Framework for implementation of DAY-NRLM, up to 30% of the total membership of the SHGs may be from among the population marginally above the poverty line, subject to the approval of other members of the group. This 30% also includes the poor households whose name does not figure in the SECC list but are as poor as those included in SECC list.

**3. Promotion of Institutions of the poor:** Strong institutions of the poor such as SHGs and their village level and higher-level federations are necessary to provide space, voice and resources for the poor and for reducing their dependence on external agencies. They empower them and also act as instruments of knowledge and technology dissemination, and hubs of production, collectivization and commerce. DAY-NRLM, therefore, would focus on setting up these institutions at various levels. In addition, DAY- NRLM would promote specialized institutions like Livelihoods collectives, producers' cooperative/companies for livelihoods promotion through deriving economies of scale, backward and forward linkages, and access to information, credit, technology, markets etc.

The Livelihoods collectives would enable the poor to optimize their limited resource.

**4. Strengthening all existing SHGs and federations of the poor.** There are existing institutions of the poor women formed by Government efforts and efforts of NGOs. DAY- NRLM would strengthen all existing institutions of the poor in a partnership mode. The self-help promoting institutions both in the Government and in the NGO sector would promote social accountability practices to introduce greater transparency. This would be in addition to the mechanisms that would be evolved by SRLMs and state governments. The learning from one another underpins the key processes of learning in DAY-NRLM.

**5. Emphasis on Training, Capacity building and skill building:** DAY-NRLM would ensure that the poor are provided with the requisite skills for managing their institutions, linking up with markets, managing their existing livelihoods, enhancing their credit absorption capacity and credit worthiness, etc. A multi-pronged approach is envisaged for continuous capacity building of the targeted families, SHGs, their federations, government functionaries, bankers, NGOs and other key stakeholders. Particular focus would be on developing and engaging community professionals and community resource persons for capacity building of SHGs and their federations and other collectives. DAY- NRLM would make extensive use of ICT to make knowledge dissemination and capacity building more effective.

**6. Revolving Fund and Community investment support Fund (C.I.F):** A Revolving Fund would be provided to eligible SHGs as an incentive to inculcate the habit of thrift and accumulate their own funds towards meeting their credit needs in the long-run and immediate consumption needs in the short-run. The C.I.F would be a corpus and used for meeting the members' credit needs directly and as catalytic capital for leveraging repeat
