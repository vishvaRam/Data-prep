# **Background**

The Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), restructured the existing Swarna Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) and launched the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM) in 2013. NULM has been under implementation w.e.f. September 24, 2013 in all district headquarters (irrespective of population) and all the cities with population of 1 lakh or more.

The Self Employment Program (SEP) of NULM focuses on providing financial assistance through provision of interest subsidy on loans to support establishment of Individual & Group Enterprises and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) of urban poor. The erstwhile provision of capital subsidy for USEP (Urban Self Employment Program) and UWSP (Urban Women Self-Help Program) under SJSRY has been replaced by interest subsidy for loans to Individual enterprise (SEP-I), Group enterprise (SEP-G) and Self Help Groups (SEP-SHGs). With a view to improving the livelihood opportunities for the poor in urban areas, erstwhile Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (UPA Division), Government of India vide their Office Memorandum No.K-14011/2/2012- UPA/FTS-5196 dated February 19, 2016 had enhanced the scope of National Urban Livelihoods Mission. The Mission with enhanced scope was renamed as **"Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana -National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)".**

The SEP will also focus on technology, marketing and other support services to the above beneficiaries engaged in micro enterprises for their livelihoods and will also facilitate issuance of credit cards for working capital requirement of the entrepreneurs.

1.2 The underemployed and unemployed urban poor will be encouraged to set up small enterprises relating to manufacturing, service and small business for which there is considerable local demand. Local skills and local crafts should be particularly encouraged. Each Urban Local Body (ULB) should develop a compendium of such activities/projects keeping in view skills available, marketability of products, costs, economic viability etc.

1.3 The percentage of women beneficiaries under SEP shall not be less than 30 percent. SCs and STs must be benefited at least to the extent of the proportion of their strength in the city/town population of poor. A special provision of 5 percent reservation should be made for the differently-abled under this program with priority to women. In view of the Prime Minister's 15-Point Program for the Welfare of Minorities, at least 15
