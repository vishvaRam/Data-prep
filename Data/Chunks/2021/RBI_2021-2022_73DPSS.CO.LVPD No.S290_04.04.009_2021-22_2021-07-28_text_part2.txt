rary, could have the potential to cause and spread instability in the system. Consequently, the customers of the non-banks, who are using their products and services, would also get affected.

# **2 Direct Access for Non-banks to CPS**

## **2.1 Meaning of Direct Access to CPS**

2.1.1 Allotment of a separate Indian Financial System Code (IFSC).

2.1.2 Opening a Current Account with the Reserve Bank in its core banking system (e-Kuber).

2.1.3 Maintaining a settlement account with the Reserve Bank.

2.1.4 Membership of Indian Financial Network (INFINET) and use of Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) to communicate with CPS.

## **2.2 Benefits of Direct Access**

2.2.1 Efficiency: For non-banks, the cost of routing payments through banks can be minimised. The risk of failure or delay in execution of fund transfers can be eliminated if the transactions are directly initiated by non-banks.

2.2.2 Competition and innovation: Non-banks increasingly and actively offer financial services which hitherto were the sole domain of banks. They are seen to be agile in coming up with innovative products and solutions as well. Direct access to CPS can further enable them to leverage technology to offer customised choices to consumers. They can use their capabilities to assimilate and analyse data to support their innovations and solutions. As non-banks compete in the same segment that banks operate, direct access can provide level playing field, minimising the need to use intermediaries.

2.2.3 Risk management and stability: As the settlement is carried out in central bank money, it greatly reduces the uncertainty in finality of the payments and settlement risk. Expanding the access and participation facilitates diversity and resiliency of the ecosystem.

2.2.4 Data protection: Direct access to CPS can enable the non-banks to safeguard customer information and fund flows, which may not be possible when using banks to provide payment services.
