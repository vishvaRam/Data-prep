## **Detection and Impounding of Counterfeit Notes**

## **Para 1- Authority to Impound Counterfeit Notes**

The Counterfeit Notes can be impounded by

- (i) All Banks
- (ii) All Treasuries and Sub-Treasuries.
- (iii) Issue Offices of Reserve Bank of India.

# **Para 2 - Detection of Counterfeit Notes**

Banknotes tendered over the counter should be examined for authenticity through machines.

Similarly, banknotes received directly at the back office / currency chest through bulk tenders should also be examined through machines.

No credit to customer's account is to be given for Counterfeit Notes, if any, detected in the tender received over the counter or at the back-office / currency chest.

In no case, the Counterfeit Notes should be returned to the tenderer or destroyed by the bank branches / treasuries. Failure of the banks to impound Counterfeit Notes detected at their end will be construed as wilful involvement of the bank concerned in circulating Counterfeit Notes and penalty will be imposed.

# **Para 3 - Impounding of Counterfeit Notes**

Notes determined as counterfeit shall be stamped as "COUNTERFEIT NOTE" and impounded in the prescribed format [\(Annex I\)](#page--1-0). Each such impounded note shall be recorded under authentication, in a separate register.

# **Para 4 - Issue of Receipt to Tenderer**

When a banknote tendered at the counter of a bank branch / back office and currency chest or treasury is found to be counterfeit, an acknowledgement receipt in the prescribed format [\(Annex II\)](#page--1-0) must be issued to the tenderer, after stamping the note as in Paragraph 3 ibid. The receipt, in running serial numbers, should be authenticated by the cashier and tenderer. Notice to this effect should be displayed prominently at the offices / branches for information of the public. The receipt is to be issued even in cases where the tenderer is unwilling to countersign it.
