To All participants in Government securities market

Madam/Sir,

## **Transactions in Government securities by Foreign Portfolio Investors: Reporting**

Over the counter (OTC) transactions in Government securities (including State Development Loans and Treasury Bills) undertaken by market participants other than on the Negotiated Dealing System – Order Matching (NDS-OM) platform are required to be reported to the 'NDS-OM' platform for settlement.

2. Based on the feedback received, it has been decided to provide operational flexibility for reporting of such transactions undertaken by the Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in Government securities, as under.

- a. FPIs/custodian banks shall report their transactions to the NDS-OM platform within three hours after the close of trading hours for the Government securities market.
- b. Information about trades undertaken by domestic counterparties with FPIs shall be disseminated by the Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd. (CDSL) after one leg of the trade is reported on the NDS-OM platform by the domestic counterparty with a suitable qualifier to indicate that the trade is awaiting counterparty confirmation.
- c. Domestic market participants, including domestic counterparties to transactions with FPIs, shall continue to report transactions to the NDS-OM platform as per extant practice.
