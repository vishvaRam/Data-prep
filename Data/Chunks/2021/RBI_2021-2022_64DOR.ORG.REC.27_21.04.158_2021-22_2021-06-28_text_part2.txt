Materiality of outsourcing would be based on:-

- i. The level of importance to the co-operative bank of the activity being outsourced as well as the significance of the risk posed by the same;
- ii. The potential impact of the outsourcing by the co-operative bank on various parameters such as earnings, solvency, liquidity, funding capital and risk profile;
- iii. The likely impact on the co-operative bank's reputation and brand value, and ability to achieve its business objectives, strategies and plans, should the service provider fail to perform the service;
- iv. The cost of the outsourcing as a proportion of total operating costs of the cooperative bank;
- v. The aggregate exposure to that particular service provider, in cases where the co-operative bank outsources various functions to the same service provider;
- vi. The significance of activities outsourced in context of customer service and protection.

4.4 Outsourcing shall not impede or interfere with the ability of a co-operative bank to effectively oversee and manage its activities nor should it impede RBI / NABARD in carrying out its supervisory functions and objectives.
