	- b. repayment is made using locally sourced IGDS (India Good Delivery Standard)/ LGDS (LBMA's Good Delivery Standards) gold;
	- c. gold is delivered on behalf of the borrower to the bank directly by the refiner or a central agency, acceptable to the bank, without the borrower's involvement;
	- d. the loan agreement contains details of the option to be exercised by the borrower, acceptable standards and manner of delivery of gold for repayment;
	- e. the borrower is apprised upfront, in a transparent manner, of the implications of exercising the option.

- ii) Banks shall suitably incorporate the above aspects into the board-approved policy governing GML along with concomitant risk management measures. Banks shall continue to monitor the end-use of funds lent under GML.
- 4. All other instructions issued on GML shall remain unchanged.
