- (i) Held to Maturity (HTM)
- (ii) Available for Sale (AFS)
- (iii) Held for Trading (HFT)

Banks should decide the category of the investment at the time of acquisition and the decision should be recorded on the investment proposals. Investments in non-SLR securities, since September 18, 2007, should be classified under HFT / AFS categories only and marked to market as applicable to these categories of investments.

However, if due to liquidity stress, UCBs are required to sell securities from HTM portfolio, they may do so with the permission of their Board of Directors and rationale for such sale may be clearly recorded. Profit on sale of investments from HTM category shall first be taken to the Profit and Loss account and, thereafter, the amount of such profit shall be appropriated to 'Capital Reserve' from the net profit for the year after statutory appropriations. Loss on sale shall be recognized in the Profit and Loss account in the year of sale.

### 15.4 **Available for Sale**

- 15.4.1 Securities which do not fall within the above two categories will be classified under AFS category.
- 15.4.2 Banks have the freedom to decide on the extent of holdings under AFS category. This may be decided by them considering various aspects such as basis of intent, trading strategies, risk management capabilities, tax planning, manpower skills, capital position, etc.
