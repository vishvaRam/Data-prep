 such assets will have well defined credit weaknesses that jeopardise the liquidation of the debt and are characterised by the distinct possibility that the banks will sustain some loss, if deficiencies are not corrected.

### 3.2.3 **Doubtful Assets**

With effect from March 31, 2005, an asset is required to be classified as doubtful, if it has remained NPA for more than 12 months. A loan classified as doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent as that classified as sub-standard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently known facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.

#### 3.2.4 **Loss Assets**

A loss asset is one where loss has been identified by the bank or internal or external auditors or by the Cooperation Department or by the Reserve Bank of India's inspection but the amount has not been written off, wholly or partly. In other words, such an asset is considered un-collectible and of such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted although there may be some salvage or recovery value.

### 3.3 **Guidelines for Classification of Assets**

### 3.3.1 **Basic Considerations**

(i) Broadly speaking, classification of assets into above categories should be done taking into account the degree of well defined credit weaknesses.

(ii) In respect of accounts where there are potential threats to recovery on account of erosion in the value of security, it will not be prudent for the banks to classify them first as sub-standard and then as doubtful after expiry of 12 months from the date the account has become NPA. Such accounts should be straight away classified as doubtful asset or loss asset, as appropriate, irrespective of the period for which they have remained as NPA.

# 3.3.2 **Advances Granted under Rehabilitation Packages Approved by Term Lending Institutions**

(i) Banks are not permitted to upgrade the classification of any advance in respect of which the terms have been re-negotiated unless the package of re-negotiated terms has worked satisfactorily for a period of one year. While the existing credit facilities sanctioned to a unit under rehabilitation packages approved by term lending institutions will continue to be classified as sub-standard or doubtful, as the case may be, in respect of additional facilities sanctioned under the rehabilitation packages, the income recognition and asset classification norms will become applicable after a period of one year from the date of disbursement.

(ii) A similar relaxation be made in respect of SSI units which are identified as sick by banks themselves and where rehabilitation packages / nursing programmes have been drawn by the banks themselves or under consortium arrangements.

# 3.3.3 **Internal System for Classification of Assets as NPA**

(i) Banks may adhere to the timelines for implementation of system-based asset classification mentioned at paragraph 2.1.4 above.

(ii) Banks, which are not required to implement system-based asset classification in terms of the instructions at paragraph 2.1.4, should establish appropriate internal systems to eliminate the tendency to delay or postpone the identification of NPAs, especially in respect of high value accounts. The banks may fix a minimum cut-off point to decide what would constitute a high value account depending upon their respective business levels. The cut-off point should be valid for the entire accounting year.

(iii) Responsibility and validation levels for ensuring proper asset classification may be fixed by the bank.

(iv) The system should ensure that doubts in asset classification due to any reason are settled through specified internal channels within one month from the date on which the account would have been classified as NPA as per extant guidelines.

(v) Banks should ensure scrupulous compliance with the instructions for recognition of credit impairment and view aberrations by dealing officials seriously.

(vi) RBI would continue to identify the divergences arising due to non-compliance, for fixing accountability. Where there is wilful non-compliance by the official responsible for classification and is well documented, RBI would initiate deterrent action including imposition of monetary penalties.

### **4. Income Recognition**

## 4.1 **Income Recognition - Policy**

4.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. Income from non-performing assets (NPA) is not recognised on accrual basis but is booked as income only when it is actually received. Therefore, banks should not take interest on non-performing assets to their income account on accrual basis.

4.1.2 However, interest on advances against term deposits, NSCs, KVPs and Life policies may be taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.

4.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of re-negotiations
