# Rural Self Employment Training Institutes (RSETIs) should be more actively involved and monitored at various fora of LBS particularly at the DCC level. Focus should be on development of skills to enhance the credit absorption capacity in the area and renewing the training programmes towards sustainable micro enterprises. RSETIs should design specific programmes for each district/ block, keeping in view the skill mapping and the potential of the region for necessary skill training and skill up gradation of the rural youth in the district.

#### **2.2.4 Role of LDMs**

As the effectiveness of the Lead Bank Scheme depends on the dynamism of the District Collectors and the Lead District Managers (LDMs), with supportive role of the Regional/Zonal Office, the office of LDM should be sufficiently strengthened with appropriate infrastructural support being the focal point for the successful implementation of the Lead Bank Scheme. Apart from the provision of a separate office space, technical infrastructure like computers, printer, data connectivity, etc. which are basic necessities for LDMs to discharge their core responsibilities may be provided to LDMs' Office without exception. Officers of appropriate level, attitude and possessing requisite leadership skills should be posted as LDMs. Additionally, it is suggested that a dedicated vehicle may be provided to LDMs' to facilitate closer liaison with the bank officials, district administration officials as also to organise/ attend various financial literacy initiatives and meetings. The absence of a specialist officer/assistant for data entry/analysis is a common and major issue faced by LDMs. Liberty to hire the services of skilled computer operator may be given to the LDMs to overcome the shortage of staff/ in case appropriate staff is not posted at LDM office. Further, for successful functioning of the Lead Bank Scheme, we expect Lead Banks to go the extra mile to provide facilities over and above the bare minimum to these critical field functionaries. Apart from the usual role of LDMs like convening meetings of the DCC/DLRC and periodical meetings of DDM/ LDO/ Government officials for resolving outstanding issues etc., the new functions envisaged for LDMs include the following:

- i) Monitoring the implementation of the District Credit Plan
- ii) Associate with the setting up of Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs), RSETIs by banks
- iii) Associate with organizing financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches of banks.
- iv) Holding annual sensitisation workshops for banks and Government officials with participation by NGOs/Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)
- v) Arranging for quarterly awareness and feedback public meetings, grievance redressal etc.

# **2.2.5 Quarterly Public Meeting and Grievance Redressal**

The Lead District Manager should convene a quarterly public meeting at various locations in the district in coordination with the LDO of Reserve Bank, banks having presence in the area and other stakeholders to generate awareness of the various banking policies and regulations relating to the common person, obtain feedback from the public and provide grievance redressal to the extent possible at such meetings or facilitate approaching the appropriate machinery for such redressal.

# **2.2.6 District Level Review Committee (DLRC) Meetings**

DLRC meetings are Chaired by the District Collector and attended by members of the District Consultative Committee (DCC). Public Representatives i.e. Local MPs/MLAs/ Zilla Parishad Chiefs are also invited to these meetings. The DLRC meetings should be convened by the Lead Banks at least once in a quarter. The DLRC is a forum to review the pace and quality of the implementation of various programmes under the Lead Bank Scheme in the district. Hence, association of nonofficials is considered useful. Lead Banks are required to ensure the presence of public representatives in DLRC meetings as far as possible. Therefore, Lead Banks should fix the date of DLRC meetings with due regard to the convenience of the representatives of the public i.e. MPs/MLAs etc. and invite and involve them in all functions conducted by the banks in the districts, such as opening of new banking outlets, distribution of Kisan Credit Cards, SHG credit linkage programmes, etc. Responses to queries from public representatives need to be accorded highest priority and attended to promptly. The follow up of the DLRC's decisions is required to be discussed in the DCC meetings.

## **2.2.7 DCC/DLRC meetings- Annual Calendar of Meetings**

i) DCC and DLRC are the important fora facilitating coordination among commercial banks, Government agencies and others at the district level to review and find solutions to the problems hindering developmental activities. Therefore, it is necessary that all the members participate and deliberate in these meetings. On a review of the DCC/DLRC meetings, it was observed that late receipt
