## **5. Community Investment Support Fund (CIF)**

CIF would be provided by MoRD to the SHGs promoted under DAY – NRLM in all blocks (intensive and non-intensive) and would be routed through the Village level/ Cluster level Federations, to be maintained in perpetuity by the Federations. The CIF would be used, by the Federations, to advance loans to the SHGs and/or to undertake the common/collective socio-economic activities.

### **6. Introduction of Interest subvention:**

DAY-NRLM has a provision for interest subvention, to cover the difference between the Lending Rate of the banks and 7%, on all credit from the banks/ financial institutions availed by women SHGs, for a maximum of ₹ 300,000/- per SHG. This would be available across the country in two ways:

(i) In 250 identified districts, banks may lend to the women SHGs @7% up to an aggregated loan amount of ₹300,000/-. The banks would be subvented to the extent of difference between the Weighted Average Interest Charged and 7%, subject to the maximum limit of 5.5%. An additional interest subvention of 3% is also available on prompt repayment by the SHGs, reducing the effective rate of interest to 4%.

(ii) In the remaining districts, the banks may lend at their respective lending rates, applicable to SHGs. In these districts, all women SHGs under DAY– NRLM would be eligible for interest subvention on prompt repayment. The difference between the bank lending rates and 7% for loans up to ₹ 300,000/- subject to a maximum limit of 5.5%, would be subvented directly in the loan accounts of the SHGs by the SRLMs. This part of the scheme would be operationalized by the SRLMs.

- Salient features of the Scheme are enclosed in [Annex](#page--1-2) II.
- The list of 250 identified districts is as per [Annex](#page--1-3) III.

### **7.1 Opening of Savings account:**

**7.1.1 Opening of Savings account of SHGs:** The role of banks would commence with opening of accounts for all the Women SHGs including members with disability and the Federations of the SHGs. The SHGs engaged in promoting of savings habits among their members would be eligible to open savings bank accounts.

- (i) Know Your Customer (KYC) verification of only the office bearers shall suffice for opening of savings bank account.
- (ii) Banks may not insist on Permanent Account Number (PAN) of SHGs at the time of opening of account or transactions and may accept declaration in Form No 60 as may be required.
- (iii) For KYC verification pertaining to SHG members during opening of accounts, instructions of Department of Banking Regulation in [Master Direction on KYC \(dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566)  February [25, 2016,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) updated as on March 23, 2021) shall be adhered to while completing Customer Due Diligence (CDD) process. CDD means identifying and verifying the customer and the beneficial owner. Accordingly, the current instructions under Simplified norms for Self Help Groups (SHGs) mention that while opening of accounts Customer Due Diligence (CDD) of all the members of SHG shall not be required and CDD of only the office bearers shall suffice. At the time of credit linking of SHGs, banks may undertake KYC verification of all the members in the SHG. However, opening of savings account of all members with the bank shall not be made a prerequisite for credit linkage of SHGs. Banks are advised to maintain separate Savings and loan account for Self Help Groups.
- (iv) Business Correspondents deployed by banks may also be authorized to open Saving Bank Accounts of the SHGs after verification/approval of the base branch, subject to adherence to extant BC guidelines and in accordance with the bank's Board approved policy on Business Correspondents. However, ensuring compliance with KYC and AML norms under the BC model continues to be the responsibility of the banks.
