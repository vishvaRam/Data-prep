# **9. Progress Reporting for SEP-I, SEP-G & SEP-SHG**

9.1 The ULB will prepare a data sheet of the applications recommended by the TASK force along with their status details of the sanction, disbursement and rejection (along with reasons) after validating the same with the respective banks. This data sheet will be sent to SULM on a monthly basis.

9.2 The SULM will compile all the reports received from respective ULBs and will communicate to Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) on a monthly basis.

9.3 SULM must ensure that progress under SEP is reviewed in every SLBC and District Consultative Committee (DCC) meetings. Any other important issue with regard to SEP may be taken up by SULM with SLBC convener bank for effective coordination and implementation.

### **10. Credit Card for enterprise development**

10.1 The financial assistance to the individual entrepreneurs though subsidized loan for setting up of enterprises under DAY-NULM could be viewed as initial impetus to facilitate livelihood support to the urban poor. However the individual entrepreneurs require further financial support in terms of working capital to make the enterprise economically sustainable. This may include immediate and short term monthly requirement of cash for meeting expenses for purchase of goods, raw materials and other miscellaneous expenditures etc. The micro-entrepreneur does not have a regular fixed monthly cash inflow/income to meet expenses arising out of entrepreneurial activities. To approach a financial institution for such immediate credit requirement, it requires procedural documentation and consumes a lot of time. This need for working capital credit is generally met from informal sources of credit (including money lenders) which is typically available at high rate of interest.

10.2 In order to support the micro-entrepreneurs to meet their working capital and miscellaneous credit needs, DAY-NULM will facilitate access to Credit Cards or MUDRA Card through banks.

10.3 The SULM in consultation with the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) will finalize the norms, limits and specifications for issuance of Credit Card (or) MUDRA Card to the individual entrepreneurs. The General Credit Card Scheme (GCC), which is being implemented by all scheduled commercial banks or any other variant of credit cards for enterprise development of banks in urban areas, may be explored by SULM and SLBC for the same. The Circular on revised GCC scheme has been issued by RBI notification vide [RPCD.MSME&NFS.BC.No.61/06.02.31/2013-14](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8603&Mode=0) dated December 02, [2013](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8603&Mode=0) available on RBI web-site ['www.rbi.org.in'](https://www.rbi.org.in/).

10.4 The ULB will identify the prospective beneficiaries and will facilitate linkages with banks for issuance of credit cards. The focus is to initially facilitate issuance of credit card to cover all the beneficiaries who have availed financial assistance under SEP. Additionally, other beneficiaries who are running their own business but have not availed assistance under SEP may also be covered if they satisfy the norms of issuance of credit cards.

10.5 The targets for the same may be decided at ULB level and the progress under this component is aggregated at SULM level and communicated to Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) periodically.

### **11. Technology, Marketing and Other Support**

11.1 Micro entrepreneurs often need support in order to grow and sustain their businesses. Support needed may be for establishment, technology, marketing, and other services. Micro entrepreneurs who run very small businesses may need to gain a better understanding of what the market needs, demand of the products produced by them, prices, where to sell, etc. Support services under this component are envisaged with a view to provide an encouraging environment for development of micro enterprises.

11.2 The City Livelihoods Centers (CLCs) established under DAY-NULM will offer services to the micro-enterprises such as in establishment (licenses, certificates registration, legal services etc.), production, procurement, technology, processing, marketing, sales, packaging, accounting etc. for long term sustainability
