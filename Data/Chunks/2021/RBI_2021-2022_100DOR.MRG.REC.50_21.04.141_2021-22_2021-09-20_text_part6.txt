## **6 ENGAGEMENT OF BROKERS**

#### 6.1 **Dealing through Brokers**

6.1.1 The inter-bank securities transactions should be undertaken directly between banks and no bank should engage the services of any broker in such transactions. Banks may, however, undertake securities transactions among themselves or with non-bank clients through members of National Stock Exchange (NSE) / BSE wherein the transactions are transparent. In case any transactions in securities are not undertaken on NSE/BSE, the same should be undertaken by the banks directly without the use of brokers.

- 6.1.2 Purchase of permissible shares and PSU bonds in the secondary market (other than inter-bank transactions) should be only through recognised stock exchanges and registered stock- brokers.
- 6.1.3 The SBI DFHI has been permitted to operate as a broker in the inter- bank participation market. This would enable the banks to seek intermediation of SBI DFHI for borrowing/lending, if required. However, the banks shall be free to settle transaction in the inter-bank participations market directly, if so desired.
- 6.1.4 If a deal is put through with the help of a broker, the role of the broker should be restricted to that of bringing the two parties to the deal together. Under no circumstances banks should give power of attorney or any other authorisation to the brokers/ intermediaries to deal on their behalf in the money and securities markets.
- 6.1.5 Disclosure of counter party should be insisted upon on conclusion of the deal put through brokers.
- 6.1.6 Contract confirmation from the counter party should be insisted upon.
- 6.1.7 The brokers should not be involved in the settlement process at all i.e., both the fund settlement and delivery of security should be done with the counterparty directly.

## 6.2 **Empanelment of Brokers**

- 6.2.1 The bank should prepare a panel of brokers with the approval of their Board of Directors.
- 6.2.2 Brokers should be empaneled after verifying their credentials e.g.:
	- (a) SEBI registration
	- (b) Membership of BSE/NSE for debt market.
	- (c) Market turnover in the preceding year as certified by the Exchange/s.
	- (d) Market reputation etc.
- 6.2.3 The bank should check websites of SEBI/respective exchanges, to ensure that the broker has not been put in the banned list.

# 6.3 **Broker Limits**

- 6.3.1 A disproportionate part of the business should not be transacted through only one or a few brokers. Banks should fix aggregate contract limits for each of the approved brokers and ensure that these limits are not exceeded. A record of broker-wise details of deals put through and brokerage paid should be maintained.
- 6.3.2 A limit of 5 per cent of total transactions (both purchases and sales) entered into by the banks during a year should be treated as the aggregate upper contract limit for each of the approved brokers.
- 6.3.3 This limit should cover both the business initiated by the bank and the business offered/brought to the bank by a broker.
- 6.3.4 It should be ensured that the transactions entered through individual brokers during a year normally do not exceed the prescribed limit. However, if it becomes necessary to exceed the aggregate limit for any broker, the specific reasons, therefore, should be recorded in writing by the authority empowered to put through the deals. In such cases, post- facto approval of the Board may be obtained a
