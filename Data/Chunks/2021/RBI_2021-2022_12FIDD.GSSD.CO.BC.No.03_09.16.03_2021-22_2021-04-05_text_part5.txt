# **8. SHG-Bank Linkage – General Guidelines**

Linking of SHGs with banks have been emphasized in the Monetary policy of Reserve Bank of India and Union Budget announcements from time to time and various guidelines in this regard have been issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to banks. To scale up the SHGs linkage program and make it sustainable, banks have been advised to consider lending to SHGs as part of their mainstream credit operations both at policy and implementation level.

8.1 Master Circular of RBI on SHG-Bank Linkage Programme, [FIDD.FID.BC.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12063)  [No.06/12.01.033/2021-22 dated April 01, 2021](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12063) contains instructions on opening of Savings Bank Account of Self Help Groups (whether registered or unregistered), which are engaged in promoting habit of savings among their members as a starting point. Thereafter, the SHGs may be sanctioned Savings Linked Loans (varying from a saving to loan ratio of 1:1 to 1:4) after due assessment or grading by banks. However, in case of matured SHGs, loans may be given beyond the limit of four times the savings as per the discretion of the bank. The Banks have also been instructed that the advances to SHGs irrespective of the purposes for which the members of SHGs should be included by the banks as part of their lending to the weaker sections.

8.2 Under Social Mobilization & Institution Development (SM&ID) component of DAY-NULM, the ULB will do necessary groundwork to open bank accounts for SHGs and facilitating access to Revolving Fund (RF). The ULB may also engage Resource Organization (RO) for the purpose or may directly facilitate SHGs through its staff. (Concept & Formation of SHGs, ROs and Revolving Fund has been detailed out in Social Mobilization & Institutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY- NULM).

8.3 The banks will send the details of disbursed loan cases to the ULB along with the calculation details of the interest subsidy amount. The ULB will check the data at their end and will release the interest subsidy amount on monthly basis to the banks following a similar procedure as mentioned in Para 5.

8.4 The ULB through its field staff or Resource Organization (ROs) will facilitate filling of loan applications for eligible SHGs to access credit from the banks. The ULB will be responsible to forward the Loan application of the SHGs to the concerned banks with requisite documentation. The ULB will maintain area wise, bank-wise, ROs/ Staff wise data of SHGs loan applications forwarded to the banks. The same will be sent to SULM on a monthly basis.

8.5 In order to ensure effective SHG-Bank Linkage under DAY-NULM, the SULM will monitor and review the progress with banks on regular basis and co-ordinate with SLBC for interest subsidy/ subvention on SHG Loans in the state. Active involvement of State level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) and lead banks may be ensured for sensitization of bank and branch staff for financial inclusion of urban poor.

8.6 It may be noted that the identification, selection, formation and monitoring of SHGs who are to get interest subvention would be the responsibility of State/ ULBs and banks would not be liable for wrong identification of SHGs who get interest subvention.
