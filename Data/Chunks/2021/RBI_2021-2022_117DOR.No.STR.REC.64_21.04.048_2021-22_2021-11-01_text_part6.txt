2.2.7.23 The special regulatory treatment for asset classification, in modification to the provisions in this regard stipulated in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8, will be available to the borrowers engaged in important business activities, subject to compliance with certain conditions as enumerated in para 2.2.7.28 below. Such treatment is not extended to the following categories of advances:

(i) Consumer and personal advances including advances to individuals against the securities of shares / bonds / debentures, etc.

(ii) Advances to traders

2.2.7.24 The asset classification of the above two categories of accounts as well as that of other accounts which do not comply with the conditions enumerated in para 2.2.7.28, will be governed by the prudential norms in this regard described in para 2.2.7.1 to 2.2.7.8 above.

2.2.7.25 The special regulatory treatment has the following two components:

(i) Incentive for quick implementation of the restructuring package.

(ii) Retention of the asset classification of the restructured account in the pre restructuring asset classification category

2.2.7.26 Incentive for Quick Implementation of the Restructuring Package

During the pendency of the application for restructuring of the advance with the bank, the usual asset classification norms would continue to apply. The process of reclassification of an asset should not stop merely because the application is under consideration. However, as an incentive for quick implementation of the package, if the approved package is implemented by the bank within 90 days from the date of receipt of application by the bank, the asset classification status may be restored to the position which existed when the restructuring application was received by the bank.

(ii) In modification to para 2.2.7.3, during the specified period, the asset classification of the sub-standard / doubtful accounts will not deteriorate upon restructuring, if satisfactory performance is demonstrated during the specified period.

(c) WCTL created by conversion of the irregular portion of principal dues over the drawing power, subject to the condition that provisions are made against the unsecured portion of the WCTL, as under :

- If the account is not eligible for upgradation after the specified period, the unsecured portion will attract provision of 100%.

iii) The repayment period of the restructured advance including the moratorium, if any, does not exceed 15 years in the case of infrastructure advances and 10 years in the case of other advances.
