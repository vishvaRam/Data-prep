**Norms for Provisioning on Loans & Advances**

5.1.1 In conformity with the prudential norms, provisions should be made on the non-performing assets on the basis of classification of assets into prescribed categories as detailed in paragraph 3 above.

5.1.2 Taking into account the time lag between an account becoming doubtful of recovery, its recognition as such, the realisation of the security and the erosion over time in the value of security charged to the bank, the banks should make provision against loss assets, doubtful assets and sub-standard assets as below:

# (i) **Loss Assets**

The entire assets should be written off after obtaining necessary approval from the competent authority and as per the provisions of the Co-operative Societies Act / Rules. If the assets are permitted to remain in the books for any reason, 100 per cent of the outstanding should be provided for.

## (ii) **Doubtful Assets**

(a) Provision should be 100 per cent of the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable value of the security to which the bank has a valid recourse. The realisable value should be estimated on a realistic basis.

(b) In regard to the **secured portion**, provision may be made on the following basis, at the rates ranging from 20 per cent to 100 per cent of the secured portion depending upon the period for which the asset has remained doubtful:


<span id="page-0-0"></span><sup>4</sup> (i) Banks having deposits below ₹ 100 crore, operating in a single district.

ii) Banks with deposits below ₹ 100 crore operating in more than one district, provided the branches are in contiguous districts and deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at least 95% of the total deposits and advances respectively of the bank.

iii) Banks with deposits below ₹ 100 crore, whose branches were originally in a single district but subsequently, became multidistrict due to reorganization of the district.

The deposits and advances as referred to in the definition may be reckoned as on 31st March of the immediate preceding financial year.

#### (iii) **Sub-standard Assets**

A general provision of 10 per cent on total outstanding should be made without making any allowance for ECGC guarantee cover and securities available.

# **(iv) Provision on Standard Assets**

(a) Tier -I banks should make a general provision of a minimum of 0.25 per cent on standard assets.

(b) Tier II banks shall maintain a general provision of minimum 0.40 per cent for 'standard advances'. However, direct advances to agricultural and SME sectors which are standard assets, would attract a uniform provisioning requirement of 0.25 per cent of the funded outstanding on a portfolio basis, as hitherto.

(c) Both Tier I & Tier II banks shall maintain a minimum provision of 1.00 percent in respect of advances to Commercial Real Estate Sector classified as 'standard assets'.

(d) Both Tier I and Tier II banks UCBs shall maintain a minimum provision of 0.75 percent in respect of advances to Commercial Real Estate-Residential Housing (CRE-RH)[6](#page-1-0) Sector classified as 'standard assets'.

(e) The standard asset provisioning requirements for all UCBs are summarized as under:


(f) The provisions towards "standard assets" need not be netted from gross advances but shown separately as "Contingent Provision against Standard Assets" under "Other Funds and Reserves" {item.2 (viii) of Capital and Liabilities} in the Balance Sheet.

(g) In case banks are already maintaining excess provision than what is required / prescribed by Statutory Auditor / RBI Inspection for impaired credits under Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve, additional provision required for Standard Assets may be segregated from Bad and Doubtful Debt Reserve and the same may be parked under the head "Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets" with the approval of their Board of Directors. Shortfall if any, on this account may be made good in the normal course.

(h) The above contingent provision will be eligible for inclusion in Tier II capital.

<span id="page-1-0"></span> <sup>6</sup> CRE-RH would consist of loans to builders/developers for residential housing projects (except for captive consumption) under CRE segment. Such projects should ordinarily not include non-residential commercial real estate. However, integrated housing projects comprising some commercial space (e.g. shopping complex, school, etc.) can also be classified under CRE-RH, provided that the commercial area in the residential housing project does not exceed 10% of the total Floor Space Index (FSI) of the project. In case the FSI of the commercial area in the predominantly residential housing complex exceeds the ceiling of 10%, the project loans should be classified as CRE and not CRE-RH.

# (v) **Higher Provisions**

There is no objection if the banks create bad and doubtful debts reserve beyond the specified l
