# **Eligibility Criteria for Appointment as SCA/SA**

## **A. Basic Eligibility**


\* Not mandatory for UCBs/NBFCs with asset size of upto ₹ 1,000 crore.

**Note 1:** There should be at least one-year continuous association of partners with the firm as on the date of empanelment (for PSBs)/ shortlisting (for other Entities) for considering them as full time partners. Further, for appointment as SCAs/SAs of all Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), and other Entities with asset size above ₹ 1,000 crore, at least two partners of the firm shall have continuous association with the firm for at least 10 years.

For all Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), and UCBs/NBFCs with asset size above ₹ 1,000 crore, the full-time partner's association with the firm would mean exclusive association. The definition of 'exclusive association' will be based on the following criteria:

(a) The full-time partner should not be a partner in other firm/s.

(d) In case of PSBs, the income of the partner from the firm/LLP should not be below the threshold limits prescribed by the Office of C&AG for the purpose of consideration as full-time partners for appointment as auditors of Public Sector Undertakings. For other Entities, the Board/ACB/LMC shall examine and ensure that the income of the partner from the firm/LLP is adequate for considering them as full-time exclusively associated partners, which will ensure the capability of the firm for the purpose.

## **Note 2:** CISA/ISA Qualification:

For UCBs and NBFCs with asset size upto ₹ 1,000 crore, there is no minimum requirement in this regard. However, such Entities may give priority to firms with full time partners or full time CAs having CISA/ISA qualification. There should be at least one-year continuous association of Paid CAs with CISA/ISA qualification with the firm as on the date of empanelment (for PSBs)/ shortlisting (for other Entities) for considering them as Paid CAs with CISA/ISA qualification for the purpose.

For UCBs and NBFCs, audit experience shall mean experience of the audit firm as Statutory Central/Branch Auditor of Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs)/ UCBs/NBFCs/ AIFIs. In case of merger and demerger of audit firms, merger effect will be given after 2 years of merger while demerger will be effected immediately for this purpose.
