2.1.3 In case of interest payments, banks should, classify an account as NPA only if the interest due and charged during any quarter is not serviced fully within 90 days from the end of the quarter.

2.1.4 In addition, an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions of this Master Circular, including inter alia Paragraphs 4.2.4, 4.2.9 and Part B2.

# 2.2 'Out of Order' status

An account should be treated as **'out of order'** if the outstanding balance remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit/drawing power for 90 days. In cases where the outstanding balance in the principal operating account is less than the sanctioned limit/drawing power, but there are no credits continuously for 90 days as on the date of Balance Sheet or credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the same period, these accounts should be treated as **'out of order'**.

# 2.3 'Overdue'

Any amount due to the bank under any credit facility is 'overdue' if it is not paid on the due date fixed by the bank.

## 3. INCOME RECOGNITION

# 3.1Income Recognition Policy

3.1.1 The policy of income recognition has to be objective and based on the record of recovery. Therefore, the banks should not charge and take to income account interest on any NPA. **This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also.**

3.1.2 However, interest on advances against Term Deposits, National Savings Certificates (NSCs), Indira Vikas Patras (IVPs), Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) and Life policies may be taken to income account on the due date, provided adequate margin is available in the accounts.

3.1.3 Fees and commissions earned by the banks as a result of renegotiations or rescheduling of outstanding debts should be recognised on an accrual basis over the period of time covered by the renegotiated or rescheduled extension of credit.

# 3.2Reversal of income

3.2.1 If any advance, including bills purchased and discounted, becomes NPA, the entire interest accrued and credited to income account in the past periods, should be reversed if the same is not realised. This will apply to Government guaranteed accounts also.

3.2.2 In respect of NPAs, fees, commission and similar income that have accrued should cease to accrue in the current period and should be reversed with respect to past periods, if uncollected.

3.2.3 Leased Assets - The *finance charge* component of finance income [as defined in 'AS 19 Leases')] on the leased asset which has accrued and was credited to income account before the asset became non performing, and remaining unrealised, should be reversed or provided for in the current accounting period.

## 3.3Appropriation of recovery in NPAs

3.3.1 Interest realised on NPAs may be taken to income account provided the credits in the accounts towards interest are not out of fresh/ additional credit facilities sanctioned to the borrower concerned.

3.3.2 In the absence of a clear agreement between the bank and the borrower for the purpose of appropriation of recoveries in NPAs (i.e. towards principal or interest due), banks should adopt an accounting principle and exercise the right of appropriation of recoveries in a uniform and consistent manner.

## 3.4Interest Application

On an account turning NPA, banks should reverse the interest already charged and not collected by debiting Profit and Loss account and stop further application of interest. However, banks may continue to record such accrued interest in a Memorandum account in their books. For the purpose of computing Gross Advances, interest recorded in the Memorandum account should not be taken into account.

# 3.5Computation of NPA levels

Banks are advised to compute their Gross Advances, Net Advances, Gross NPAs and Net NPAs, as per the format in **Annex -1**.

### 4. ASSET CLASSIFICATION

## 4.1Categories of NPAs

Banks are required to classify non performing assets further into the following three categories based on the period for which the asset has remained non performing and the realisability of the dues:

- **(i) Substandard Assets**
- **(ii) Doubtful Assets**
- **(iii) Loss Assets**

### 4.1.1 Substandard Asse
