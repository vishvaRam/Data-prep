on exposures to such borrowers are likely to be higher. It is reiterated that no additional facilities should be granted by any bank/FI to the listed wilful defaulters, in terms of Paragraph 2.5 (a) of [Master Circular on](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9907)  [Wilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2015.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9907)

- c) With a view to discouraging borrowers/defaulters from being unreasonable and noncooperative with lenders in their bonafide resolution/recovery efforts, banks may classify such borrowers as non-cooperative borrowers[23](#page-2-0), after giving them due notice if satisfactory clarifications are not furnished. Banks will be required to report classification of such borrowers to CRILC. Detailed instructions in this regard have been issued vide [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9420&Mode=0)  [DBR.No.CID.BC.54/20.16.064/2014-15 dated December 22, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9420&Mode=0) on Non-Cooperative Borrowers.
- d) Further, if any particular entity is reported as non-cooperative, any fresh exposure to such a borrower will, by implication, entail greater risk necessitating higher provisioning. Banks/FIs will therefore be required to make higher provisioning as applicable to substandard assets in respect of new loans sanctioned to such borrowers as also new loans sanctioned to any other company that has on its board of directors any of the whole time directors/promoters of a non-cooperative borrowing company or any firm in which such a non-cooperative borrower is in charge of management of the affairs. However, for the purpose of asset classification and income recognition, the new loans would be treated as standard assets. This is a prudential measure since the expected losses on exposures on exposures to such non-cooperative borrowers are likely to be higher.

<span id="page-2-0"></span> <sup>23</sup> A non-cooperative borrower is one who does not engage constructively with his lender by defaulting in timely repayment of dues while having ability to pay, thwarting lenders' efforts for recovery of their dues by not providing necessary information sought, denying access to assets financed / collateral securities, obstructing sale of securities, etc. In effect, a noncooperative borrower is a defaulter who deliberately stone walls legitimate efforts of the lenders to recover their dues.

India (ICAI) to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the auditors. RBI reiterates these instructions for strict compliance. Pending disciplinary action by ICAI, the complaints may also be forwarded to the RBI (Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office) and IBA for records. IBA would circulate the names of the CA firms against whom many complaints have been received amongst all banks who should consider this aspect before assigning any work to them. RBI would also share such information with other financial sector regulators/Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)/Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

29.3 Further, banks may seek explanation from advocates who wrongly certify as to clear legal titles in respect of assets or valuers who overstate the security value, by negligence or connivance, and if no reply/satisfactory clarification is received from them within one month, they may report their names to IBA. The IBA may circulate the names of such advocates/valuers among its members for consideration before availing of their services in future. The IBA would create a central registry for this purpose.
