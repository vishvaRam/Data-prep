Dear Sir/Madam,

## **Large Exposures Framework – Credit Risk Mitigation (CRM) for offsetting – non-centrally cleared derivative transactions of foreign bank branches in India with their Head Office**

Please refer to [circular No.DBR.No.BP.BC.43/21.01.003/2018-19 dated June 03, 2019](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11573&Mode=0) on Large Exposures Framework (LEF).

2. It is advised that the Indian branches of foreign banks shall be permitted to reckon cash/unencumbered approved securities, the source of which is interest-free funds from Head Office or remittable surplus retained in Indian books (reserves), held with RBI under 11(2)(b)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act,1949 ('BR Act') as CRM, for offsetting the gross exposure of the foreign bank branches in India to the Head Office (including overseas branches) for the calculation of LEF limit, subject to the following conditions:

- (i) The amount so held shall be over and above the other regulatory and statutory requirements and shall be certified by the statutory auditors.
- (ii) The amount so held shall not be included in regulatory capital. (i.e., no double counting of the fund placed under Section 11(2) as both capital and CRM). Accordingly, while assessing the capital adequacy of a bank, the amount will form part of regulatory adjustments made to Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.
