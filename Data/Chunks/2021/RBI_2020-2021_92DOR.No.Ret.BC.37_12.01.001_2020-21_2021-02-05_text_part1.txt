Dear Sir / Madam

## **Credit to MSME Entrepreneurs**

In terms of paragraph 5 of the [Statement on Developmental and Regulatory](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51078) Policies of [February 5, 2021,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=51078) Scheduled Commercial Banks will be allowed to deduct the amount equivalent to credit disbursed to 'New MSME borrowers' from their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) for calculation of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR). For the purpose of this exemption, 'New MSME borrowers' shall be defined as those MSME borrowers who have not availed any credit facilities from the banking system as on January 1, 2021. This exemption will be available only up to â‚¹25 lakh per borrower disbursed up to the fortnight ending October 1, 2021, for a period of one year from the date of origination of the loan or the tenure of the loan, whichever is earlier.

2. Banks are required to report the exemption availed at the end of a fortnight, in Annex A to Form A as per [Master Circular on Cash Reserve Ratio \(CRR\) and Statutory](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9905)  [Liquidity Ratio \(SLR\) dated July 1, 2015,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9905) under the item "Any other liabilities coming under the purview of zero prescription" at VIII.1.
