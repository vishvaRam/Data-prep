#### **Master Circular Income Recognition, Asset Classification, Provisioning and Other Related Matters**


# **1. General**

1.1 In order to reflect a bank's actual financial health in its balance sheet and as per the recommendations made by the Committee on Financial System (Chairman Shri M. Narasimham), the Reserve Bank has introduced, in a phased manner, prudential norms for income recognition, asset classification and provisioning for the advances portfolio of the banks.

1.2 Broadly, the policy of income recognition should be objective and based on record of recovery rather than on any subjective considerations. Likewise, the classification of assets of banks has to be done on the basis of objective criteria, which would ensure a uniform and consistent application of the norms. The provisioning should generally be made on the basis of the classification of assets into different categories.

1.3 The requirements of the State Co-operative Societies Acts and / or rules made thereunder or other statutory enactments may continue to be followed, if they are more stringent than those prescribed hereby.

1.4 With the introduction of prudential norms, the Health Code based system for classification of advances has ceased to be a subject of supervisory interest. As such, all related reporting requirements, etc. also ceased to be a supervisory requirement, but could be continued in the banks entirely at their discretion and the management policy, if felt necessary.

# **2. Non-performing Assets (NPA)**

### 2.1 **Classification of Assets as Non-Performing**

2.1.1 An asset becomes non-performing when it ceases to generate income for the bank.

2.1.2 With a view to moving towards international best practices and to ensure greater transparency, '90 days' **overdue[1](#page-2-0)** norms for identification of NPAs have been made applicable from the year ended March 31, 2004. As such, with effect from March 31, 2004, a non-performing asset is a loan or an advance where:

(i) Interest and / or installment of principal remain overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of a Term Loan.

(ii) The account remains **'Out of order'[2](#page-2-1)**, in respect of an Overdraft / Cash Credit (OD/CC).

(iii) The bill remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in the case of bills purchased and discounted.

(iv) In the case of direct agricultural advances as listed in [Annex 1,](#page--1-1) the overdue norm specified at para 2.1.3 would be applicable. In respect of agricultural loans, other than those specified in [Annex 1,](#page--1-1) identification of NPAs would be done on the same basis as non-agricultural advances.

(v) Any amount to be received remains overdue for a period of more than 90 days in respect of other accounts.

(vi) In addition, an account may also be classified as NPA in terms of certain specific provisions of this Master Circular, including *inter alia* paragraphs 2.2.7 and clarifications provided under the frequently asked questions (FAQs) in [Annex-4.](#page--1-0)

 <sup>1</sup> Any amount due to the bank under any credit facility, if not paid by the due date fixed by the bank becomes overdue.

<span id="page-2-1"></span><span id="page-2-0"></span><sup>2</sup> An account should be treated as 'out of order' if the outstanding balance remains continuously in excess of the sanctioned limit / drawing power for 90 days. In cases where the outstanding balance in the principal operating account is less than the sanctioned limit / drawing power, but there are no credits continuously for 90 days as on the date of balance sheet or credits are not enough to cover the interest debited during the same period, these accounts should be treated as 'out of order'.

### 2.1.3 **Agricultural Advance**

(i) With effect from September 30, 2004, the following norms are applicable to all direct agricultural advances [\(Annex 1\)](#page--1-1):

a) A loan granted for short duration crops will be treated as NPA, if the installment of principal or interest thereon remains overdue for two crop seasons.

b) A loan granted for long duration crops will be t
