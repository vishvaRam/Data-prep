2. In terms of paragraph 6 of the above circulars, CRISIL Limited has been accredited for the purpose of risk weighting the banks' claims for capital adequacy purposes along with other credit rating agencies (CRAs) registered with Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The rating business of CRISIL Limited has since been transferred to CRISIL Ratings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of CRISIL Limited in compliance with SEBI's notification dated September 11, 2018 read with SEBI's circular dated September 19, 2018. Banks may therefore, use the ratings of the CRISIL Ratings Limited for the purpose of risk weighting their claims for capital adequacy purposes. The rating-risk weight mapping for the long term and short-term ratings assigned by CRISIL Ratings Limited will be the same as was in the case of CRISIL Limited and there is no change in the rating symbols earlier assigned by CRISIL Limited.
