b) The scope of the internal audit shall exclude any assessment of the correctness of decisions taken by the IO.

**14**. Supervisory Oversight: The areas relating to customer service and customer grievance redress, as well as the implementation of this direction, shall be a part of the risk assessment and supervisory review undertaken by the Reserve Bank.
