aken on the internal audit findings within given timelines and status on closure of audit reports is placed before the ACB/Board.

appropriate ethics and values within the organization; and ensure effective performance management and staff accountability, etc.

The following key-attributes need to be observed:

# **I. Authority, Stature, Independence and Resources**

The internal audit function must have sufficient authority, stature, independence and resources thereby enabling internal auditors to carry out their assignments properly. The Head of Internal Audit (HIA) shall be a senior executive with the ability to exercise independent judgement. The HIA and the internal audit functionaries shall have the authority to communicate with any staff member and get access to all records that are necessary to carry out the entrusted responsibilities.

#### **II. Competence**

Requisite professional competence, knowledge and experience of each internal auditor is essential for the effectiveness of internal audit function. The areas of knowledge and experience may include banking/financial entity's operations, accounting, information technology, data analytics, forensic investigation, among others. The collective skill levels should be adequate to audit all areas of the SE.

#### **III. Rotation of Staff**

Except for the entities where the internal audit function is a specialised function and managed by career internal auditors, the Board should prescribe a minimum period of service for staff in the internal audit function. The Board may also examine the feasibility of prescribing at least one stint of service in the internal audit function for those staff possessing specialized knowledge useful for the audit function, but who are posted in other areas, so as to have adequate skills for the staff in the internal audit function.

# **IV. Tenor for appointment of Head of Internal Audit**

Except for the entities where the internal audit function is a specialised function and managed by career internal auditors, the HIA shall be appointed for a reasonably long period, preferably for a minimum of three years.

#### **V. Reporting Line**

The HIA shall directly report to either the ACB/Board/ MD & CEO or to the Whole Time Director (WTD). Should the Board of Directors decide to allow the MD & CEO or a WTD to be the 'Reporting authority', then the 'Reviewing authority' shall be the ACB/Board and the 'Accepting authority' shall be the Board in matters of performance appraisal of the HIA.

Further, in such cases, the ACB/Board shall meet the HIA at least once in a quarter, without the presence of the senior management (including the MD & CEO/WTD). The HIA shall not have any reporting relationship with the business verticals of these SEs and shall not be given any business targets.

# **VI. Remuneration**

The independence and objectivity of the internal audit function could be undermined if the remuneration of internal audit staff is linked to the financial performance of the business lines for which they exercise audit responsibilities. Thus, the remuneration policies should be structured in a way to avoid creating conflict of interest and compromising audit's independence and objectivity.

# **VII. Responsibilities and Other General Expectations**

- 1. The internal audit function should work on the basis of established policies and procedures as approved by the ACB/Board.
- 2. The internal audit shall undertake an independent risk assessment for the purpose of formulating a risk-based audit plan. This risk assessment would cover risks at various levels/areas (corporate and branch, the portfolio and individual transactions, etc.) as also the associated processes.
- 3. The risk assessment in the internal audit department should be used for focusing on the material risk areas and prioritizing the audit work.
- 4. The risk assessment process should, inter alia, include identification of inherent business risks in various activities undertaken, evaluation of the effectiveness of the control systems for monitoring the inherent risks of the business activities ('Control risk') and drawing-up a risk-matrix for both the factors viz., inhe
