Since the Nodal/Focal Point branch will also be reporting the April 2021 transactions pertaining to year 2021-22 in addition to March 2021 Residual transactions, monthly statement for April 2021 transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2021 (year 2021-22) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as "March Residual Account".
