The Chairpersons/ CEOs of all the Regulated Entities

Madam/Sir,

# **Amendment to the Master Direction (MD) on KYC**

Please refer to the Master Direction (MD) [on KYC dated February 25, 2016,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11566) as amended from time to time, in terms of which Regulated Entities (REs) have to undertake Customer Due Diligence (CDD) while dealing with the customers as per the process laid out therein.

2. In this regard, on a review, it has been decided to amend the MD on KYC to further leverage the Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) and to simplify and rationalise the process of periodic updation of KYC. The amended provisions read as under:

## **I. V-CIP:**

# **Clause (xx) of Section 3: Amended Definition of V-CIP**:

*Video based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) is an alternate method of customer identification with facial recognition and customer due diligence by an authorised official of the RE by undertaking seamless, secure, live, informed-consent based audio-visual interaction with the customer to obtain identification information required for CDD purpose, and to ascertain the veracity of the information furnished by the customer through independent verification and maintaining audit trail of the process. Such processes complying with prescribed standards and procedures shall be treated on par with face-toface CIP for the purpose of this Master Direction.* 

# **Clause (v) of Section 17:**

*v. Accounts, both deposit and borrowal, opened using OTP based e-KYC shall not be allowed for more than one year unless identification as per Section 16 or as per Section 18 (V-CIP) is carried out, If Aadhaar details are used under Section 18, the process shall be followed in its entirety including fresh Aadhaar OTP authentication.*

### **Amended Section 18 on V-CIP:**

*REs may undertake V-CIP to carry out:*

- *i) CDD in case of new customer on-boarding for individual customers, proprietor in case of proprietorship firm, authorised signatories and Beneficial Owners (BOs) in case of Legal Entity (LE) customers. Provided that in case of CDD of a proprietorship firm, REs shall also obtain the equivalent e-document of the activity proofs with respect to the proprietorship firm, as mentioned in Section 28, apart from undertaking CDD of the proprietor. ii) Conversion of existing accounts opened in non-face to face mode using Aadhaar*
- *OTP based e-KYC authentication as per Section 17.*
- *iii) Updation/Periodic updation of KYC for eligible customers.*

*REs opting to undertake V-CIP, shall adhere to the following minimum standards:* 

### *(a) V-CIP Infrastructure*

*(i) The RE should have complied with the RBI guidelines on minimum baseline cyber security and resilience framework for banks, as updated from time to time as well as other general guidelines on IT risks. The technology infrastructure should be housed in own premises of the RE and the V-CIP connection and interaction shall necessarily originate from its own secured network domain. Any technology related outsourcing for the process should be compliant with relevant RBI guidelines.* 

*(ii) The RE shall ensure end-to-end encryption of data between customer device and the hosting point of the V-CIP application, as per appropriate encryption standards. The customer consent should be recorded in an auditable and alteration proof manner.*

*(iii) The V-CIP infrastructure / application should be capable of preventing connection from IP addresses outside India or from spoofed IP addresses.* 

*(iv) The video recordings should contain the live GPS co-ordinates (geo-tagging) of the customer undertaking the V-CIP and date-time stamp. The quality of the live video in the V-CIP shall be adequate to allow identification of the customer beyond doubt.*

*(v) The application shall have components with face liveness / spoof detection as well as face matching technology with high degree of accuracy, even though the ultimate responsibility of any customer identification rests with the RE. Appropriate artificial intelligence (AI) technology can be used to ensure that the V-CIP is robust.*

*(vi) Based on experience of detected / attempted / 'near-miss' cases of forged identity, the technology infrastructure including application software as well as work flows shall be regularly upgraded. Any detected case of forged identity through V-CIP shall be reported as a cyber security event under extant regulatory guidelines.*

*(vii) The V-CIP infrastructure shall undergo necessary tests such as Vulnerabi
