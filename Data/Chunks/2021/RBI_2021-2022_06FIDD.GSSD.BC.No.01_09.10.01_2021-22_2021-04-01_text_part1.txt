# **1. Credit Facilities to Minority Communities:**

The Government of India has indicated that care should be taken to see that minority communities secure, in a fair and adequate measure the benefits flowing from various Government sponsored schemes. Accordingly, all commercial banks are advised to ensure smooth flow of bank credit to minority communities.

Government of India has also forwarded a list of 121 minority concentration districts having at least 25% minority population, excluding those States / UTs where minorities are in majority (J & K, Punjab, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland and Lakshadweep). Accordingly, all scheduled commercial banks are advised to specially monitor the credit flow to minorities in these 121 districts, thereby, ensuring that the **minority communities receive a fair and equitable portion of the credit within the overall target of the priority sector** (list of Minority Concentration Districts at **[Annexure I](#page--1-0)**).

In terms of Reserve Bank's extant guidelines on lending to priority sector, a target of 40 percent of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures (OBE), whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to the priority sector by domestic scheduled commercial banks and foreign banks with 20 and above branches, for Small Finance Banks it is 75% of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC). Within this, a sub-target of 12 per cent of ANBC or Credit Equivalent amount of OBE, whichever is higher, as on March 31 of the previous year, has been mandated for lending to weaker sections which includes, among others, persons from minority communities. Revised targets for weaker sections shall be implemented in a phased manner as indicated in Para 5.2 of RBI Master Directions on Priority Sector lending (Targets and Classification) dated September 04, 2020

### **2**. **Definition of Minority Communities**

- 2.1 The following communities have been notified as minority communities by the Government of India, Ministry of Minority Affairs;
	- (a) Sikhs
	- (b) Muslims
	- (c) Christians
	- (d) Zoroastrians
	- (e) Buddhists
	- (f) Jains

2.2 In the case of a partnership firm, if the majority of the partners belong to one or the other of the specified minority communities, advances granted to such partnership firms may be treated as advances granted to minority communities. Further, if the majority beneficial ownership in a partnership firm belongs to the minority community, then such lending can be classified as advances to the specified communities. A company has a separate legal entity and hence advances granted to it cannot be classified as advances to the specified minority communities.

### **3. Creation of Special Cell and Designating an exclusive Officer**

- 3.1 A Special Cell should be set up in each bank to ensure smooth flow of credit to minority communities and
