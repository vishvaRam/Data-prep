e Service Area Approach (SAA), introduced in April 1989 for planned and orderly development of rural and semi-urban areas was applicable to all scheduled commercial banks including Regional Rural Banks. Under SAA, each bank branch in a rural or semi-urban area was designated to serve an area of 15 to 25 villages and the branch was responsible for meeting the needs of bank credit of its service area. The primary objective of SAA was to increase productive lending and forge effective linkages between bank credit, production, productivity and increase in income levels.

ii) The Service Area Approach scheme was reviewed in December 2004 and it was decided to dispense with the restrictive provisions of the scheme while retaining the positive features of the SAA such as credit planning and monitoring of the credit purveyance. Accordingly, under SAA, the allocation of villages among the rural and semi-urban branches of banks were made not applicable for lending except under Government Sponsored Schemes. Thus, while the commercial banks and RRBs are free to lend in any rural and semi-urban area, the borrowers have the choice of approaching any branch for their credit requirements.

## **8.1 Dispensing with 'No Due Certificate'**

In order to ensure hassle free credit to all borrowers, especially in rural and semiurban areas and keeping in view the technological developments and the different ways available with banks to avoid multiple financing, banks have been advised to dispense with obtaining a 'No Due Certificate' from the individual borrowers (including SHGs & JLGs) in rural and semi-urban areas for all types of loans including loans under Government Sponsored Schemes, irrespective of the amount involved unless the Government Sponsored Scheme itself provides for obtention of a 'No Due Certificate'. Further, it has been clarified that the policy of dispensing with a 'No Due Certificate' for lending by banks is also applicable to urban areas including metropolitan cities.

ii) Banks are encouraged to use an alternative framework of due diligence as part of the credit appraisal exercise other than the 'No Due Certificate' which could, among others, consist of one or more of the following:

- Credit history check through Credit Information Companies (CICs)
- Self-declaration or an affidavit from the borrower
- CERSAI registration
- Peer monitoring
- Information sharing among lenders
- Information search (writing to other lenders with an auto deadline)
- iii) Banks are also advised to submit information/data to all Credit Information Companies (CICs), as required in terms of extant instructions issued by RBI.

## **9. Doubling of Farmers' Income by 2022**

i) The Government of India, in the Union Budget 2016-17, had announced its resolve to double the income of farmers by 2022. Several steps have been taken towards attaining this objective including setting up of an inter-ministerial committee for preparation of a blue print for the same. This agenda has also been reiterated by the government in several fora and has acquired primacy from the point of view of rural and agricultural development.

ii) The strategy to achieve this goal, inter-alia, includes,

- Focus on irrigation with large budgets, with the aim of "per drop, more crop"
- Provision of quality seeds and nutrients based on soil health of each field
- Investments in warehousing and cold chains to prevent post-harvest crop losses
- Promotion of value addition through food processing
- Creation of a national farm market, removing distortions and development of infrastructure such as e-platform across 585 stations
- Strengthening of the crop insurance scheme to mitigate risks at affordable cost
- Promotion of ancillary activities like poultry, bee-keeping and fisheries

iii. Needless to emphasize that acceleration in income generation is significantly dependent on better capital formation in agriculture. Towards this, banks should revisit their documentation for crop loans, simplify them where required and ensure speedy sanctioning and disbursal of loans within specified time limits.

iv. The Lead Bank Scheme, which ensures inter-departmental/governmental coordination in the financial sector, should, therefore, be leveraged to further the objective of doubling farmers' income by 2022. Lead Banks are accordingly advised to ensure the following:

- a. Work closely with NABARD in the preparation of Potential Linked Credit Plans (PLPs) & Annual Credit Plans (ACPs) keeping the above strategy in consideration
- b. Include 'Doubling of Farmers' Income by 2022' as a regular agenda under the Lead Bank Scheme in various fora such as SLBC, DCC, DLRC and BLBC
- c. For the purpose of monitoring and reviewing the progress, Lead Banks may use the benchmarks as may be provided by NABARD
- d. Map the overall strategy as given in para 9 (ii) above to the agriculture/agroancillary lending plan of the bank.
