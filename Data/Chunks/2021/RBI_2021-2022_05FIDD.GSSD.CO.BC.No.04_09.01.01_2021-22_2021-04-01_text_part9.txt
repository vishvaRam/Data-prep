have accessed loan from commercial and cooperative banks. The funding for this subvention would be met out of the Central Allocation and State Contribution as per the norms of Government of India.

iii. The SHGs would be subvented to the extent of difference between the lending rate of the banks and 7% subject to a maximum limit of 5.5% by the SRLMs, directly on a monthly/quarterly basis. An e-transfer of the subvention amount would be made by the SRLM to the loan accounts of the SHGs who have repaid promptly. In case the loan account is already closed, or e-transfer to the loan account is not successful due to any reason, the subvention amount may be transferred to the corresponding savings account of the concerned SHGs.

iv. For the purpose of the Interest Subvention, an account would be considered as prompt payee if it satisfies the following criterion:

- a. For Cash Credit Limit:
	- 1. Outstanding balance shall not have remained in excess of the limit/drawing power continuously for more than 30 days
	- 2. There should be regular credit and debits in the accounts. In any case there shall be at least one customer induced credit during a month
	- 3. Customer induced credit should be sufficient to cover the interest debited during the month.

b. For the Term loans: A term loan account where all of the interest payments and/or instalments of principal were paid within 30 days of the due date during the tenure of the loan, would be considered as an account having prompt payment

v. Women SHGs who have availed capital subsidy under SGSY in their existing loans, would not be eligible for benefit of Interest Subvention for their subsisting loan under this scheme.

vi. SRLMs should submit Quarterly Utilization Certificate indicating subvention amounts transferred to the Loan accounts of the eligible SHGs.

**III.** The States with state specific interest subvention schemes are advised to harmonize their guidelines with the Central scheme.
