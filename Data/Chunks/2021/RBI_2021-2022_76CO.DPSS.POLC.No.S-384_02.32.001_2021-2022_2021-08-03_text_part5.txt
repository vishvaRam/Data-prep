	- a) are appropriately documented in written agreements with details like scope of services, charges for services and maintaining confidentiality of customer's data;
	- b) do not cause any confusion among customers as to whose products / services they are availing, by clear physical demarcation of the site of activities of different group entities;

This includes having appropriate contingency and exit strategies. In principle, arrangements shall only be entered into with parties operating in jurisdictions generally upholding confidentiality clauses and agreements. The governing law of the arrangement shall also be clearly specified.
