Madam / Dear Sir,

## **Resolution Framework 2.0 – Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)**

Please refer to the [circular DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 6, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11942&Mode=0) on restructuring of advances to the MSME borrowers.

2. In view of the uncertainties created by the resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic in India in the recent weeks, it has been decided to extend the above facility for restructuring existing loans without a downgrade in the asset classification subject to the following conditions:

(i) The borrower should be classified as a micro, small or medium enterprise as on March 31, 2021 in terms of the Gazette Notification S.O. 2119 (E) dated June 26, 2020.

(ii) The borrowing entity is GST-registered on the date of implementation of the restructuring. However, this condition will not apply to MSMEs that are exempt from GST-registration. This shall be determined on the basis of exemption limit obtaining as on March 31, 2021.

(iii) The aggregate exposure, including non-fund based facilities, of all lending institutions to the borrower does not exceed ₹25 crore as on March 31, 2021.

(iv) The borrower's account was a 'standard asset' as on March 31, 2021.

(v) The borrower's account was not restructured in terms of the [circulars](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11942&Mode=0)  [DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 6, 2020;](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11942&Mode=0) [DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019-20 dated February 11, 2020;](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11808&Mode=0) or [DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018-19 dated January 1, 2019](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11445&Mode=0) (collectively referred to as MSME restructuring circulars).

(vi) The restructuring of the borrower account is invoked by September 30, 2021. For this purpose, the restructuring shall be treated as invoked when the lending institution and the borrower agree to proceed with the efforts towards finalising a restructuring plan to be implemented in respect of such borrower. The decisions on applications received by the lending institutions from their customers for invoking restructuring under this facility shall be communicated in writing to the applicant by the lending institutions within 30 days of receipt of such applications. The decision to invoke the restructuring under this facility shall be taken by each lending institution having exposure to a borrower independent of invocation decisions taken by other lending institutions, if any, having exposure to the same borrower.

(vii) The restructuring of the borrower account is implemented within 90 days from the date of invocation.

(viii) If the borrower is not registered in the Udyam Registration portal, such registration shall be required to be completed before the date of implementation of the restructuring plan for the plan to be treated as implemented.

(ix) Upon implementation of the restructuring plan, the lending institutions shall keep provision of 10 percent of the residual debt of the borrower.

(x) It is reiterated that lending institutions shall put in place a Board approved policy on restructuring of MSME advances under these instructions at the earliest, and in any case not later than a month from the date of this circular.

(xi) All other instructions specified in the [circular DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11942&Mode=0)  [August 6, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11942&Mode=0) shall remain applicable.
