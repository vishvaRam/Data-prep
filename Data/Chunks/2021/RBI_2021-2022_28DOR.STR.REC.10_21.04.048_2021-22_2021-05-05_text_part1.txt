Dear Sir/ Madam,

## **Utilisation of Floating Provisions/Counter Cyclical Provisioning Buffer**

Please refer to our [circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.89/21.04.048/2005-06 dated June 22,](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=2918&Mode=0)  [2006](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=2918&Mode=0) and [DBOD.No.BP.BC.68/21.04.048/2006-07 dated March 13, 2007](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=3334&Mode=0) on creation, accounting, disclosures and utilisation of floating provisions by banks. Banks may also refer to our [circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.87/21.04.048/2010-11 dated April 21, 2011](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6357&Mode=0) on creation and utilisation of 'countercyclical provisioning buffer', wherein we had advised that the buffer will be allowed to be used by banks for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, *inter alia*, during periods of system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI.

2. Accordingly, in terms of our [circulars DBOD.No.BP.95/21.04.048/2013-14 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8737&Mode=0)  [February 7, 2014](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8737&Mode=0) and [DBR.No.BP.BC.79/21.04.048/2014-15 dated March 30, 2015,](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9624&Mode=0) banks were allowed to utilise upto 33 per cent and 50 per cent of floating provisions/ countercyclical provisioning buffer held by them as on March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 respectively, for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, as per their Board approved policy.

3. In order to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID 19 related stress on banks, as a measure to enable capital conservation, it has been decided to allow banks to utilise 100 per cent of floating provisions/ countercyclical provisioning buffer held by them as on December 31, 2020 for making specific provisions for non-performing assets with prior approval of their Boards. Such utilisation is permitted with immediate effect and upto March 31, 2022.

Yours faithfully,

(Manoranjan Mishra) Chief General Manager
