The community structures formed under Social Mobilization & Institutional Development (SM&ID) component of DAY- NULM viz. Self Help Groups (SHGs) and Area Level Federations (ALFs) may also refer prospective individual and group entrepreneurs for purpose of financial assistance under SEP to ULB. The beneficiaries may directly approach ULB or its representatives for assistance. Banks may also identify prospective beneficiaries at their end and forward such cases directly to ULB. The Banks may also use their empaneled Business Correspondents (BCs) and Business Facilitators (BFs) to increase the outreach. Due diligence will be undertaken as per the Banks' policy, in this regard.

The State Urban Livelihoods Mission (SULM) may develop a Loan Application Form (LAF) in suitable format in consultation with State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) convenor bank. The same LAF may be utilised across the State/UTs. The Loan Application Form (LAF) will contain basic data in respect of economic status of the beneficiary and her/his family.
