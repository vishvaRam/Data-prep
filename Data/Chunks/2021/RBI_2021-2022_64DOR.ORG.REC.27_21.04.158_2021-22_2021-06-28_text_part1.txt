The Chief Executive Officer All Co-operative Banks

Madam / Dear Sir,

# **Guidelines for Managing Risk in Outsourcing of Financial Services by Cooperative Banks**

It is observed that the co-operative banks are increasingly using outsourcing as a means for reducing costs as well as for availing specialist expertise, where these are not available internally.

2. While it is entirely the banks' prerogative to take a view on the desirability of outsourcing a permissible activity having regard to all relevant factors, including the commercial aspects of the decision, such outsourcing results in banks being exposed to various risks. To enable the co-operative banks to put in place necessary safeguards for addressing the risks inherent in outsourcing of activities, guidelines on managing risks in outsourcing are given in [Annex.](#page--1-0)

3. Co-operative banks are advised to conduct a self-assessment of their existing outsourcing arrangements and bring the same in line with these guidelines within a period of six months from the date of issue of this circular.

Yours faithfully

(Sunil T. S. Nair) Chief General Manager

### **Guidelines on Managing Risks in Outsourcing of Financial services by Cooperative Banks**

### **Introduction**

1.1 'Outsourcing' is defined as use of a third party to perform activities on a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by a co-operative bank itself, now or in the future. 'Continuing basis' would include agreements for a limited period.

1.2 These guidelines are intended to provide direction and guidance to co-operative banks to adopt sound and responsive risk management practices for effective oversight, due diligence and management of risks arising from outsourcing activities.

1.3 The underlying principles behind these guidelines are that the co-operative bank should ensure that outsourcing arrangements neither diminish its ability to fulfil its obligations to customers and RBI, nor impede effective supervision by Reserve Bank of India (RBI)/ National Bank for Agriculture and Development (NABARD)[1](#page--1-1) . Co-operative banks, therefore, have to take steps to ensure that the service provider employs the same high standard of care in performing the services as would be employed by them, if the activities were conducted by the banks and not outsourced. Accordingly, cooperative banks should not engage in outsourcing that would result in their internal control, business conduct or reputation being compromised or weakened.

1.4 These guidelines are concerned with managing risks in outsourcing of financial services and are not applicable to technology-related issues as also activities not related to financial services like usage of courier, catering of staff, housekeeping and janitorial services, security of the premises, movement and archiving of records, etc. Co-operative banks which desire to outsource would not require prior approval from RBI / NABARD. However, such arrangements would be subject to on-site / off-site monitoring and inspection/scrutiny by RBI / NABARD.

<sup>1</sup> Reserve Bank of India is the supervisor for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks. National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development is the supervisor for State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks. The word 'RBI/NABARD' mentioned in these guidelines may be interpreted in relation to the relevant supervising authority of co-operative banks.

## **2. Activities that shall not be outsourced**

Co-operative banks which choose to outsource financial services, however, shall not outsource core management functions including policy formulation, internal audit and compliance, compliance with KYC norms, credit sanction and management of investment portfolio. However, where required, experts, including former employees, could be hired on a contractual basis subject to the Audit Committee of Board/Board being assured that such expertise does not exist within the audit function of the bank. Any conflict of interest in such matters shall be recognised and effectively addressed. Ownership
