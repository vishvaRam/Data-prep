2.12 The banks will send a periodic report to the ULB on the status of the applications received. In case of MIS being used, the banks may be allowed to update the status of application online in addition to manual report.

2.13 Banks may also directly accept the loan applications of urban poor beneficiaries on the basis of relevant documents as per the guidelines of Prime Minister MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) or any other such scheme without the need of having prior sponsoring from ULB. The banks can send details of such loans sanctioned by them to ULBs for confirmation of their eligibility for interest subsidy under DAY-NULM. Task Force constituted for scrutinizing applications should quickly clear these applications if they otherwise meet the criteria. On confirmation of their eligibility, interest subsidy may be claimed from ULBs on the pattern of interest subsidy claim for beneficiaries sponsored by ULBs. The subsidy will be transferred directly to the loan account of DAY-NULM beneficiaries. This procedure will also be direct benefit transfer compliant.

The difference between 7% p.a. and the rate of interest charged by the bank will be provided to banks under DAY-NULM. Interest subsidy will be given only in case of timely repayment of loan. Suitable certification from banks will be obtained in this regard. An additional 3 percent interest subvention will be provided to all Women Self Help Groups (WSHGs) who repay their loan in time. The Interest subsidy will be subject to timely repayment of the loan (as per the loan repayment schedule) and suitable certification obtained from banks by the ULB. The additional 3% interest subvention amount will be reimbursed to the eligible WSHGs.
