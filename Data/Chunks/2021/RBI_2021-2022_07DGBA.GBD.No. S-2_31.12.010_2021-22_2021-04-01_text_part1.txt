# **MASTER CIRCULAR ON AGENCY COMMISSION**

#### **Introduction**

**1.** The Reserve Bank of India carries out the general banking business of the Central and State Governments through its own offices and through the offices of the agency banks appointed under Section 45 of the RBI Act, 1934, by mutual agreement. RBI pays agency commission to the agency banks for the government business handled by them. This Master Circular consolidates the instructions contained in the circulars listed in [Annex](#page--1-0) 1.

### **Government transactions eligible for agency commission**

2. Transactions relating to the following government business undertaken by agency banks are eligible for agency commission paid by RBI:

- (a) Revenue receipts and payments on behalf of the Central/State Governments
- (b) Pension payments in respect of Central / State Governments and
- (c) Any other item of work specifically advised by Reserve Bank as eligible for agency commission

3. The Agency banks also undertake the work related to Small Savings Schemes (SSS) the commission for which is borne by Government of India. Though the settlement of commission on such SSS is processed by RBI and settled at Central Accounts Section (CAS), Nagpur, the rates of agency commission related to SSS transactions are decided by Government of India. Agency commission claims on Special Deposit Scheme (SDS) related transactions (where mirror accounts are maintained in RBI) are also settled at CAS, Nagpur.

4. Short term/long term borrowings of State Governments raised directly from financial institutions and banks are not eligible for agency commission as these transactions are not considered to be in the nature of general banking business. Reserve Bank pays the agency banks separate remuneration as agreed upon for acting as agents for management of public debt.

5. Whenever agency banks collect stamp duty through physical mode or e-mode (challan based), they are eligible for payment of agency commission, provided the agency banks do not collect any charges from the members of public or receive remuneration from the State Government for doing this work.

6. If the agency bank is engaged by the State Government as Franking Vendor and it collects stamp duty from the public for franking the documents, it will not be eligible for agency commission since the State Government is paying commission to it as Franking Vendor. However, the agency bank which collects the stamp duty paid by the Franking Vendor for credit to the Treasury through challan in physical or emode for purchase of the franking bar, would be eligible for agency commission since it is a regular payment of Stamp Duty as stated above.

# **Government transactions not eligible for agency commission**

7. Agency banks paying their own tax liabilities through their own branches or through authorised branches of any other agency bank including State Bank of India or offices of Reserve Bank of India wherever they do not have their own authorised direct tax collection branch should indicate the same separately in the scroll. Such transactions will not be eligible for payment of agency commission. Banks should furnish a certificate to the effect that own tax liabilities (TDS, Corporation Tax, etc.) paid by them have been excluded while claiming agency commission.

8. The following activities, inter alia, do not come under the purview of agency bank business and are therefore not eligible for payment of agency commission.

(a) Furnishing of bank guarantees/security deposits, etc. through agency banks by g
