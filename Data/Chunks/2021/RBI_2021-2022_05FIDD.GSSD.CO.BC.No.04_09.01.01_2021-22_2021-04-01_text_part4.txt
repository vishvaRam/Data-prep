**7.3.4** All facilities sanctioned under DAY- NRLM would be governed by the Asset Classification norms issued by Reserve Bank of India from time to time.

## **7.4. Security and Margin:**

No collateral and no margin would be charged up to â‚¹10.00 lakh limit to the SHGs. No lien should be marked against savings bank account of SHGs and no deposits should be insisted upon while sanctioning loans

# **7.5. Dealing with Defaulters**:

It is desirable that willful defaulters should not be financed under DAY-NRLM. In case willful defaulters are members of a group, they might be allowed to benefit from the thrift and credit activities of the group including the corpus built up with the assistance of Revolving Fund. But at the stage of accessing bank loan by SHG for financing economic activities by its members, the willful defaulters should not have the benefit of such bank loan until the outstanding loans are repaid. Willful defaulters of the group should not get benefits under the DAY-NRLM Scheme and the group may be financed excluding such defaulters while documenting the loan. However, banks should not deny loan to entire SHG on the pretext that spouse or other family members of individual members of SHG being a defaulter with the bank. Further, non-willful defaulters should not be debarred from receiving the loan. In case default is due to genuine reasons, banks may follow the norms suggested for restructuring the account with revised repayment schedule.

## **8 Credit Target Planning**

8.1 Based on the Potential Linked Plan/State Focus Paper prepared by NABARD, SLBC sub-committee on SHG Bank Linkage may arrive at the district-wise, block-wise and branch-wise credit plan. The sub- committee should consider the existing SHGs, New SHGs proposed, and number of SHGs eligible for fresh and repeat loans as suggested by the SRLMs to arrive at the credit targets for the states. The targets so decided should be approved in the SLBC and reviewed and monitored periodically for effective implementation.

8.2 The district-wise credit plans should be communicated to the DCC. The Blockwise/Cluster-wise targets are to be communicated to the bank branches through the Controllers**.**

### **9 Post credit follow- up**

9.1 Loan pass books or statement of accounts in regional languages may be issued to the SHGs which may contain all the details of the loans disbursed to them and the terms and conditions applicable to the loan sanctioned. The passbook should be updated with every transaction made by the SHGs. At the time of documentation and disbursement of loan, it is advisable to clearly explain the terms and conditions as part of financial literacy.

9.2 Bank branches may observe one fixed day in a fortnight to enable the staff to go to the field and attend the meetings of the SHGs and Federations to observe the operations of the SHGs and keep a track of the regularity in the SHGs meetings and performance.

### **10 Repayment:**

Prompt repayment of the loans is necessary to ensure the success of the programme. Banks shall take all possible measures, i.e. personal contact, organization of joint recovery camps with District Mission Management Units (DPMUs) /District Rural Development Agency(DRDAs) to ensure the recovery of loans. Keeping in view, the importance of loan recovery, banks should prepare a list of defaulting SHGs under DAY-NRLM every month and furnish the list in the BLBC, DCC meetings. This would ensure that DAY-NRLM staff at the district/ block level would assist the bankers in initiating the repayment

### **11 Supervision and monitoring of the Scheme**

Banks may set up cells for Self Help Groups at respective Regional/Zonal offices of banks. These cells should periodically monitor and review the flow of credit to the SHGs, ensure the implementation of the guidelines to the scheme, collect data from the branches and make available consolidated data to the Head office and the DAY-NRLM units at the districts/ blocks. The cell should also discuss this consolidated data in the SLBC, BLBC and DCC meetings regularly to maintain the effective communication with the state staff and all banks.
