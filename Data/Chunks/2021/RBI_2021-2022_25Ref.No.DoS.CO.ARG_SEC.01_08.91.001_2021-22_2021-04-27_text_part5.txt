# **Procedure for Appointment of SCAs/SAs**

1. The Entities shall shortlist minimum of 2 audit firms for every vacancy of SCAs/SAs so that even if firm at first preference is found to be ineligible/refuses appointment, the firm at second preference can be appointed and the process of appointment of SCAs/SAs does not get delayed. However, in case of reappointment of SCAs/SAs by banks/UCBs till completion of tenure of continuous term of 3 years, there would not be any requirement of shortlisting and sending names of multiple audit firms to RBI while seeking approval to appointment.

2. The banking companies shall continue to follow the existing procedure followed by them for selection of SCAs/SAs. They shall place the name of shortlisted audit firms, in order of preference, before their ACB/LMC for selection as SCAs/SAs. Upon selection of SCAs/SAs by the bank in consultation with their ACB/LMC and verifying their compliance with the eligibility norms prescribed by RBI, the bank shall seek RBI's prior approval for appointment of SCAs/SAs.

3. For PSBs, empanelment of audit firms eligible for appointment as SCAs will continue to be done by the Office of C&AG, based on the norms prescribed by RBI, as on January 1 of the relevant year.

The list of firms as furnished by C&AG to RBI will be subjected to scrutiny by RBI for identifying the eligible firms and excluding audit firms who have been denied audit by C&AG/RBI. RBI will forward a single list[14](#page--1-1) of all audit firms eligible for appointment as SCAs to all PSBs on an annual basis. PSBs shall shortlist audit firms from the said list of eligible audit firms as received from RBI, based on certain objective criteria (like number of full time partners, number of professional staff, number of CISA/ISA qualified partners/paid CAs, number of FCAs, etc.) as laid down in the bank's policy for appointment of statutory auditors.
