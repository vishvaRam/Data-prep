ok income on accrual basis beyond two years from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts.

<span id="page-3-0"></span> <sup>7</sup> For greenfield projects, financial closure is defined as a legally binding commitment of equity holders and debt financiers to provide or mobilise funding for the project. Such funding must account for a significant part of the project cost which should not be less than 90 per cent of the total project cost securing the construction of the facility.

ii. Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets as under:


For the purpose of these guidelines, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same.

## **2. Project Loans for Non-Infrastructure Sector**

2.1 A loan for a non-infrastructure project will be classified as NPA during any time before commencement of commercial operations as per record of recovery (90 days overdue), unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 below.

2.2 A loan for a non-infrastructure project will be classified as NPA if it fails to commence commercial operations within six months from the original DCCO, even if it is regular as per record of recovery, unless it is restructured and becomes eligible for classification as 'standard asset' in terms of paras 2.3 and 2.4 below.

2.3 In case of non-infrastructure projects, if the delay in commencement of commercial operations extends beyond the period of six months from the date of completion as determined at the time of financial closure, banks can prescribe a fresh DCCO, and retain the "standard" classification by undertaking restructuring of accounts in accordance withprudential guidelines on restructuring of advances at paragraph 2.2.7 above, provided the fresh DCCO does not extend beyond a period of twelve months from the original DCCO. This would among others also imply that the restructuring application is received before the expiry of six months from the original DCCO, and when the account is still "standard" as per the record of recovery.

The other conditions applicable would be:

a) In cases where there is moratorium for payment of interest, banks should not book income on accrual basis beyond six months from the original DCCO, considering the high risk involved in such restructured accounts.

b) Banks should maintain provisions on such accounts as long as these are classified as standard assets as under:


2.4 For this purpose, mere extension of DCCO will also be treated as restructuring even if all other terms and conditions remain the same.

3. These guidelines will however not be applicable to restructuring of commercial real estate and housing loans.

## **4. Other Issues**

4.1 All other aspects of restructuring of project loans before commencement of commercial operations would be governed by the instructions on restructuring of advances as contained in this Master Circular.

4.2 Any change in the repayment schedule of a project loan caused due to an increase in the project outlay on account of increase in scope and size of the project, would not be treated as restructuring if:

i) The increase in scope and size of the project takes place before commencement of commercial operations of the existing project.

ii) The rise in cost excluding any cost-overrun in respect of the original project is 25% or more of the original outlay.

iii) The bank re-assesses the viability of the project before approving the enhancement of scope and fixing a fresh DCCP.

iv) On re-rating, (if already rated) the new rating is not below the previous rating by more than one notch.
