(iv) Depending upon the duration of crops raised by an agriculturist, the above NPA norms would also be made applicable to agricultural term loans availed of by him.

#### 2.1.4 **Identification of Assets as NPAs should be done on an ongoing basis**

(i) The system should ensure that identification of NPAs is done on an on-going basis and accounts are classified as NPA immediately, as soon as they turn into NPA as per the guidelines contained in this circular, without waiting till the end of quarter/financial year. Banks should also make provisions for NPAs as at the end of each calendar quarter i.e. as at the end of March / June / September / December, so that the income and expenditure account for the respective quarters as well as the P&L account and balance sheet for the year end reflects the provision made for NPAs.

(ii) UCBs having total assets of ₹2000 crore or above as on March 31, 2020 were required to implement system-based asset classification[3](#page-3-0) with effect from June 30, 2021.

(iv) UCBs which meet the above criteria as at the end of the financial year 2020-2021 or subsequent financial years shall implement system-based asset classification within a period of six months from the end of the financial year concerned. For smooth implementation of the system, such UCBs may conduct pilot/parallel run and evaluate the results for accuracy/integrity of the asset classification in compliance with the applicable RBI instructions so as to ensure that they are ready for implementation of the system-based asset classification from the appointed date.

<span id="page-3-0"></span> <sup>3</sup> 'System-based asset classification' would mean asset classification (downgrading as well as upgrading) carried out by the CBS / computerized systems of the bank in an automated manner on an ongoing basis, based on the relevant RBI instructions/guidelines.
