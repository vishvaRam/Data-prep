Please refer to paras 2.2 and 2.2.1 of the [circular DOR \(PCB\).BPD.Cir](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11819&Mode=0)  [No.10/13.05.000/2019-20 dated March](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11819&Mode=0) 13, 2020, in terms of which, UCBs were required, *inter alia*, to have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising of Small Value Loans, i.e., loans of value not more than ₹25 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of ₹1 crore, per borrower. The target date for complying with the above requirement was March 31, 2024.

3. All other provisions with regard to prudential limits prescribed in the [circular dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11819&Mode=0)  [March 13, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11819&Mode=0) referred to above remain unchanged.
