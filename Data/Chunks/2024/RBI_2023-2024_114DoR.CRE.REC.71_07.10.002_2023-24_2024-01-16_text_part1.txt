## **Master Circular on Exposure Norms and Statutory / Other Restrictions – UCBs**

## <span id="page-2-0"></span>**1. General**

1.1 As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of concentration of credit risk, primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) have been advised to fix limits on their exposure -

- (i) to individual borrowers and group borrowers;
- (ii) to specific sectors; and,
- (iii) towards unsecured advances.

1.2 In addition, these banks are also required to observe certain statutory and regulatory restrictions in respect of:

- (i) advances against shares, debentures and bonds;
- (ii) investments in shares, debentures and bonds.

1.3 Currently operative instructions on all these aspects are detailed in the following paragraphs.

## <span id="page-2-1"></span>**2. Definitions**

## 2.1 Tier-I Capital

Tier-I capital as on March 31 of the preceding financial year shall be reckoned for the purpose of fixing the exposure limits. Tier-I capital for the purpose will be the same as that prescribed for computation of capital adequacy of UCBs (vide [Master Circular](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490)  [dated April 20, 2023 on Prudential Norms on Capital Adequacy\)](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12490), as amended from time to time.

2.2 Exposure shall include both credit exposure (Loans and Advances) and investment exposure (Non- SLR securities) as indicated below.

## 2.3 Credit Exposure

#### 2.3.1 Credit exposure shall include -

(a) funded and non-funded credit limits and underwriting and similar commitments;

(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing and hire purchase financing; and,

(c) ad hoc limits sanctioned to the borrowers to meet the contingencies.

2.3.2 Credit exposure shall not include loans and advances granted against the security of bank's own term deposits.

2.3.3 The sanctioned limit or outstanding whichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at credit exposure limit. Further, in case of fully drawn term loans, where there is no scope of re-drawal of any portion of the sanctioned limit, banks may reckon the outstanding for arriving at credit exposure limit.

2.3.4 In respect of non-funded credit limit, 100 per cent of such limit or outstanding, whichever is higher, need be taken into account for the purpose.

2.3.5 The level of individual bank's share in Consortium / Multiple Banking / Syndication shall be governed by single borrower / group exposure.

## 2.4 Investment Exposure (Non-SLR securities)

UCBs shall be guided by provisions contained at Chapter VII of the [Master Direction](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473)  [on 'Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio of UCBs'](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) dated April [1, 2023,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12473) as updated from time to time.

#### 2.5 Group

2.5.1 The decision in regard to definition of a group is left to the perception of the UCBs, which are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele. The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs may, therefore, be decided by the UCBs on the basis of relevant information available with them, the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management and effective control.

2.5.2 The different firms with one or more common partners engaged in the same line of business, *viz*., manufacturing, processing, trading activity, etc. shall be deemed to be connected group and units coming under common ownership shall be deemed to be a single party.

#### 2.6 Unsecured advances

Unsecured advances shall include clean overdrafts, loans against personal security, clean bills or *Multani hundies* purchased or discounted, cheques purchased and drawals allowed against cheques sent for collection but shall exclude:

(i) advances backed by guarantee of the central or state governments, public sector financial institutions, banks and Deposit Insurance & Credit Guarantee Corporation;

(ii) advances again
