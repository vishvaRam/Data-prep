multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, and hotels) where the prospects for repayment would depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. Additionally, the prospect of recovery in the event of default would also depend primarily on the cash flows generated from such funded asset which is taken as security, as would generally be the case. The primary source of cash flow (i.e., more than 50% of cash flows) for repayment would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the assets as also for recovery in the event of default where such asset is taken as security.

3. In certain cases where the exposure may not be directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by CRE. For example, exposures taken against existing commercial real estate whose prospects of repayments primarily depend on rental / sale proceeds of the real estate should be classified as CRE. Other such cases may include extension of guarantees on behalf of companies engaged in commercial real estate activities, corporate loans extended to real estate companies etc.

4. It follows from the definition at para 2 and 3 above that if the repayment primarily depends on other factors such as operating profit from business operations, quality of goods and services, tourist arrivals etc., the exposure would not be counted as Commercial Real Estate.

5. UCBs should not extend finance for acquisition of land even if it is part of a project. However, finance can be granted to individuals for purchase of a plot, provided a declaration is obtained from the borrower that he intends to construct a house on the said plot, within such period as may be laid down by the banks themselves.

# **Simultaneous Classification of CRE into other Regulatory Categories**

6. It is possible for an exposure to get classified simultaneously into more than one category, real estate, CRE, infrastructure etc. as different classifications are driven by different considerations. In such cases, the exposure would be reckoned for regulatory / prudential exposure limit, if any, fixed by RBI or by the bank itself, for all the categories to which the exposure is assigned. For the purpose of capital adequacy, the largest of the risk weights applicable among all the categories would be applicable for the exposure. The rationale for such an approach is that, while at times certain classifications / categorizations could be driven by socio-economic considerations and may be aimed at encouraging flow of credit towards certain activities, these exposures should be subjected to appropriate risk management / prudential / capital adequacy norms so as to address the risk inherent in them. Similarly, if an exposure has sensitivity to more than one risk factor it should be subjected to the risk management framework applicable to all the relevant risk factors.

7. In order to assist banks in determining as to whether a particular exposure should be classified as CRE or not, some examples based on the principles described above are given below. Based on the above principles and illustrations given, banks should be able to determine, whether an exposure not included in the illustrative examples is a CRE or not and should record a reasoned note justifying the classification.

# **Illustrative Examples**

## **A. Exposures which should be classified as CRE**

1. Loans extended to builders for construction of any property which is intended to be sold or given on lease (e.g., loans extended to builders for housing buildings, hotels, restaurants, gymnasiums, hospitals, condominiums, shopping malls, office blocks, theatres, amusement parks, cold storages, warehouses, educational institutions, industrial parks). In such cases, the source of repayment in normal course would be the cash flows generated by the sale / lease rentals of the property. In case of default of the loan, the recovery will also be made from sale of the property if the exposure is secured by these assets as would generally be the case.

#### 2. Loans for Multiple Houses intended to be rented out

The housing loans extended in cases where houses are rented out need to be treated differently. If the total number of such units is more than two, the exposure for the third unit onwards may be treated as CRE exposure as the borrower may be renting these housing units and the rental income would be the primary source of repayment.

#### 3. Loans for Integrated Township Projects

Where the CRE is part of a big project which has small non-CRE component, it will be classified as CRE exposure since the primary source of repayment for such exposures would be the sale proceeds of buildings meant for sale.

4. Exposures to Real Estate Companies

In some cases, exposure to real estate companies is not directly linked to the creation or acquisition of CRE, but the repayment would come from the cash flows generated by Commercial Real Estate. Such
