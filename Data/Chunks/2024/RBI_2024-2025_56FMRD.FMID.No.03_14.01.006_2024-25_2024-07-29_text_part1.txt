Madam/Sir,

## **'Fully Accessible Route' for Investment by Non-residents in Government Securities – Exclusion of new issuances in 14-year and 30-year tenor securities**

A reference is invited to the Fully Accessible Route introduced by the Reserve Bank, *vide* [A.P.](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11849&Mode=0)  [\(DIR Series\) Circular No. 25 dated March 30, 2020,](https://rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11849&Mode=0) wherein certain specified categories of Central Government securities were opened fully for non-resident investors without any restrictions, apart from being available to domestic investors as well.

2. The Government Securities that are eligible for investment under the Fully Accessible Route ('specified securities') were notified by the Bank, *vide* [circular no.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11850&Mode=0)  [FMRD.FMSD.No.25/14.01.006/2019-20 dated March 30, 2020,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11850&Mode=0) [circular no.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12354&Mode=0)  [FMRD.FMID.No.04/14.01.006/2022-23 dated July 07, 2022,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12354&Mode=0) [circular no.

Consequently, future issuances of Government Securities in these tenors shall not be available for investment under the Fully Accessible Route. Existing stocks of Government Securities in 14-year and 30-year tenors already included as 'specified securities' under the Fully Accessible Route shall, however, continue to be available under the Fully Accessible Route for investments by non-residents in the secondary market.
