Madam/ Dear Sir,

### **Priority Sector Lending – Amendments to the Master Directions**

Please refer to [Master Directions \(MD\) on Priority Sector Lending \(PSL\)](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) dated [September 04, 2020](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959) as updated from time to time. The following paras of the Directions stand amended in view of factors detailed thereunder.

### 2. **Para 7 - Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement:**

The MD specifies that the lists of districts with comparatively high and low PSL credit detailed in Annex IA and IB of the MD are valid until FY 2023-24 subject to review thereafter. Based on a review, the lists of districts have been updated. These lists will remain valid until FY 2026-27 and will be reviewed thereafter. Accordingly, from FY 2024-25 onwards, a higher weight (125%) would be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) would be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). Therefore, [para 7 of the](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#Adjustments)  [MD on PSL](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=11959#Adjustments) has been updated as mentioned above.

## 3. **Para 9 - Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises:**
