All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks

Madam/Sir,

**Review of Instructions on Bulk Deposits for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs)** Please refer to Para 3 (a) (i) of [Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India \(Co-operative](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10394)  [Banks - Interest Rate on Deposits\) Directions, 2016 dated May 12, 2016,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10394) in terms of which "Bulk Deposit" means single Rupee term deposits of Rupees fifteen lakh and above.

2. On a review, it has been decided to enhance the bulk deposit limit for Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, in Tier 3 and 4, to Rupees one crore and above. Accordingly, "Bulk Deposit" for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks would now mean:

i. Single Rupee term deposits of Rupees one crore and above for Scheduled UCBs categorised as Tier 3 and 4 UCBs under the revised regulatory framework.

ii. Single Rupee term deposits of Rupees fifteen lakh and above for all other UCBs

(i.e., other than Scheduled UCBs in Tier 3 and 4).

The relevant sections of the Master Direction as amended are indicated in the [Annex.](#page-1-0)

3. All other instructions in this regard shall remain unchanged.

Yours faithfully,

(Sunil T. S. Nair) Chief General Manager
