As announced in the [Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=57276)  [February 8, 2024,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=57276) it has been decided to harmonize the instructions on the subject. This is being done in order to enhance transparency and reduce information asymmetry on financial products being offered by different regulated entities, thereby empowering borrowers for making an informed financial decision. The harmonised instructions shall be applicable in cases of all retail and MSME term loan products extended by all regulated entities (REs).

- 3. For the purpose of this circular, following terms have been defined:
	- (a) **Key Facts** of a loan agreement between an RE/a group of REs and a borrower are legally significant and deterministic facts that satisfy basic information required to assist the borrower in taking an informed financial decision.
	- (b) **Key Facts Statement (KFS)** is a statement of key facts of a loan agreement, in simple and easier to understand language, provided to the borrower in a standardised format.
- (c) **Annual Percentage Rate (APR**) is the annual cost of credit to the borrower which includes interest rate and all other charges associated with the credit facility.
- (d) **Equated Periodic Instalment (EPI)** is an equated or fixed amount of repayments, consisting of both the principal and interest components, to be paid by a borrower towards repayment of a loan at periodic intervals for a fixed number of such intervals; and which result in complete amortisation of the loan. EPIs at monthly intervals are called EMIs.
