ents to develop a tendency of defaulting in payments when invoked guarantees are honoured by the banks.
- **2.5.8** (i) Banks are required to ensure that the guarantees issued by them are honoured without delay and hesitation when they are invoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deed, unless there is a Court order restraining the banks.

(ii) Any decision not to honour the obligation under the guarantee invoked may be taken after careful consideration, at a fairly senior level, and only in the circumstances where the bank is satisfied that any such payment to the beneficiary would not be deemed a rightful payment in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.

(iii) The Chief Executive Officers of banks should assume personal responsibility for such complaints received from Government departments. Sufficient powers should be delegated to the line functionaries so that delay on account of reference to higher authorities for payment under the guarantee does not occur.

(iv) For any non-payment of guarantee in time, staff accountability should be fixed and stern disciplinary action including award of major penalty such as dismissal, should be taken against the delinquent officials at all levels.

(v) Where banks have executed bank guarantees in favour of Customs and Central Excise authorities to cover differential duty amounts in connection with interim orders issued by High Courts, the guarantee amount should be released immediately when they are invoked on vacation of the stay orders by Courts. Banks should not hold back the amount on the pretext that it would affect their liquidity position.

**2.5.9** There have also been complaints by Ministry of Finance that some of the departments such as Department of Revenue, Government of India are finding it difficult to execute judgements delivered by various Courts in their favour as banks do not honour their guarantees, unless certified copies of the Court judgements are made available to them. In this regard, the banks may follow the following procedure:

(i) Where the bank is a party to the proceedings initiated by Government for enforcement of the bank guarantee and the case is decided in favour of the Government by the Court, banks should not insist on production of certified copy of the judgement, as the judgement/ order is pronounced in open Court in presence of the parties/ their counsels and the judgement is known to the bank and a copy of the judgement is available on websites of the Courts.

(ii) In case the bank is not a party to the proceedings, a signed copy of the minutes of the order certified by the Registrar/ Deputy or Assistant Registrar of the High Court or the ordinary copy of the judgement/ order of the High Court, duly attested to be true copy by Government Counsel, should be sufficient for honouring the obligation under guarantee, unless the guarantor bank decides to file any appeal against the order of the High Court.

(iii) Banks should honour the guarantees issued by them as and when they are invoked in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantee deeds. In case of any disputes, such honouring can be done under protest, if necessary, and the matters of dispute pursued separately.

(iv) The Government, on their part, have advised the various Government departments, etc. that the invocation of guarantees should be done after careful consideration at a senior-level that a default has occurred in accordance with the terms and conditions of the guarantees and as provided in the guarantee deed.

(v) Non-compliance of the instructions in regard to honouring commitments under invoked guarantees will be viewed by Reserve Bank very seriously and Reserve Bank will be constrained to take deterrent action against the banks.

### **2.6 Co-acceptance of bills**

### **2.6.1 General**

Reserve Bank has observed that some banks co-accept bills of their customers and also discount bills co-accepted by other banks in a casual manner. These bills subsequently turn out to be accommodation bills drawn by groups of sister concerns on each other where no genuine trade transaction takes place. Banks, while discounting such bills, appear to ignore this important aspect presumably because of the co-acceptance given by other banks. The bills, on maturity, are not honoured by the drawees and the banks which co-accept the bills have to make payment of these bills, and they find it difficult to recover the amount from the drawers/ drawees of bills. Banks also discount bills for sizeable amounts, which are co-accepted by certain Urban Co-operative Banks. On maturity, the bills are not honoured and the cooperative banks, which co-accept the bills, also find it difficult to make the payment. The financial position and capacity of the co-accepting bank to honour the bills, in the event of need, is not being looked into. Cases have also been observed where the particulars regarding
