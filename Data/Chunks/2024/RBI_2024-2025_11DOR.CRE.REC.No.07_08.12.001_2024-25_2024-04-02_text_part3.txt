as possible and, in any case, within three years, so as to ensure quick re-cycling of bank funds for optimum results. If the project covers construction of houses, credit extended therefor in respect of individual beneficiaries should be on the same terms and conditions as stipulated for financing the beneficiary directly.

(b) Banks should have a Board approved policy in place for valuation of properties including collaterals accepted for their exposures and that valuation should be done by professionally qualified independent valuers.

(c) As regards the valuation of land for the purpose of financing of land acquisition as also land secured as collateral, banks may be guided as under:

(i) Banks may extend finance to public agencies and not to private builders for acquisition and development of land, provided it is a part of the complete project, including development of infrastructure such as water systems, drainage, roads,

**"DOR – MC – Housing Finance – 2024"**

provision of electricity, etc. In such limited cases where land acquisition can be financed, the finance is to be limited to the acquisition price (current price) plus development cost. The valuation of such land as prime security should be limited to the current market price.

(ii) Wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.

### **(ii) Lending to Housing Finance Institutions**

Banks may grant term loans to housing finance institutions taking into account (longterm) debt-equity ratio, track record, recovery performance and other relevant factors including the provisions of Master Circular - [Bank Finance to Non-Banking Financial](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12476)  [Companies \(NBFCs\) dated April](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=12476) 03, 2023, as amended from time to time.

### **(iii) Lending to Housing Boards and Other Agencies**

Banks may extend term loans to state level housing boards and other public agencies. However, in order to develop a healthy housing finance system, while doing so, the banks must not only keep in view the past performance of these agencies in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but they should also stipulate that the Boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan instalments from the beneficiaries.

### **(iv) Term Loans to Private Builders**

- a. In view of the important role played by professional builders as providers of construction services in the housing field, especially where land is acquired and developed by State Housing Boards and other public agencies, commercial banks may extend credit to private builders on commercial terms by way of loans linked to each specific project.
- b. Banks however, are not permitted to extend fund based or non-fund based facilities to private builders for acquisition of land even as part of a housing project.
- c. The period of credit for loans extended by banks to private builders may be decided by banks themselves based on their commercial judgment subject to usual safeguards and after obtaining such security, as banks may deem appropriate.
- d. Such credit may be extended to builders of repute, employing professionally qualified personnel. It should be ensured, through close monitoring, that no part of such funds is used for any speculation in land.
- e. Care should also be taken to see that prices charged from the ultimate beneficiaries do not include any speculative element, that is, prices should be based only on the documented price of land, the actual cost of construction and a reasonable profit margin.

#### **(v) Terms and Conditions for Lending to Housing Intermediary Agencies**

- a. In order to enhance the flow of resources to housing sector, term loans may be granted by banks to housing intermediary agencies against the direct loans sanctioned/ proposed to be sanctioned by the latter, irrespective of the per borrower size of the loan extended by these agencies.
- b. Banks can grant term loans to housing intermediary agencies against the direct loans sanctioned/proposed to be sanctioned by them to Non-Resident Indians also. However, banks should ensure that housing finance intermediary agencies being financed by them are authorised by RBI to grant housing loans to NRIs as all housing finance intermediaries are not authorised by RBI to provide housing finance to NRIs.

#### **(vi) Adherence to guidelines on Commercial Real Estate (CRE) exposure**

Lending to housing intermediary agencies will be subject to the [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5261&Mode=0)  [DBOD.BP.BC.No.42/08.12.015/2009-10](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5261&Mode=0) dated September 9, 2009 on Guidelines on classification of exposures as commercial real estate (CRE) exposure and the [circular](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8047&Mode=0)  [DBOD.BP.BC.No.104/
