Madam / Dear Sir,

## **Note Sorting Machines: Standards issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards**

 Reference is invited to our [circular DCM \(NPD\) No.S488/18.00.14/2022-23 dated July 01,](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=12347&fn=2753&Mode=0)  [2022](https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/FS_Notification.aspx?Id=12347&fn=2753&Mode=0) on "Note Sorting Machines - Authentication and Fitness Sorting Parameters".

2. With a view to further strengthen the banknote sorting architecture across the country, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) after due consultation with Reserve Bank of India and other stakeholders, had published the standards for Note Sorting Machines (NSM) – 'IS 18663: 2024' in the 'Gazette of India' on March 19, 2024. The standards are available at [https://www.services.bis.gov.in/tmp/LITD42522283\\_07032024\\_1.pdf.](https://www.services.bis.gov.in/tmp/LITD42522283_07032024_1.pdf)

3. As a step further in this regard, it has been decided that effective May 01, 2025, banks should deploy only such NSM models that conform to the aforesaid Indian Standards and are duly certified by BIS.

Yours faithfully

(Sanjeev Prakash) Chief General Manager-in-Charge
