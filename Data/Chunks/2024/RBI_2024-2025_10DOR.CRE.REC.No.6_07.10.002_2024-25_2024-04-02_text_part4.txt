 period etc. in respect of additional / supplementary finance may be same as indicated in respect of loans for construction / acquisition.

#### <span id="page-6-1"></span>**6. Lending to Housing Boards**

6.1 UCBs may extend loans to housing boards within their States. The rate of interest to be charged on the loans to such boards may be fixed at the discretion of the banks.

6.2 While extending loans to housing boards, banks may not only keep in view the past performance of the housing boards in the matter of recovery from the beneficiaries but should also stipulate that the boards will ensure prompt and regular recovery of loan instalments from the beneficiaries.

# <span id="page-6-2"></span>**7. Advances to Builders / Contractors**

7.1 Builders / contractors generally require huge funds, take advance payments from the prospective buyers or from those on whose behalf construction is undertaken and, therefore, may not normally require bank finance for the purpose. Any financial assistance extended to them by UCBs may result in dual financing. Banks should, therefore, normally refrain from sanctioning loans and advances to this category of borrowers.

7.2 However, where contractors undertake comparatively small construction work on their own, (i.e., when no advance payments are received by them for the purpose), banks may consider extending financial assistance to them against the hypothecation of construction materials, provided such loans and advances are in accordance with the bye laws of the bank and instructions / directives issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time.

7.3 Banks should undertake a proper scrutiny of the relevant loan applications, and satisfy themselves, among other things, about the genuineness of the purpose, the quantum of financial assistance required, creditworthiness of the borrower, repayment capacity, etc. and also observe the usual safeguards, such as, obtaining periodic stock statements, carrying out periodic inspections, determining drawing power strictly on the basis of the stock held, maintaining a margin of not less than 40 to 50 percent, etc. They should also ensure that materials used up in the construction work are not included in the stock statements for the purpose of determining the drawing power.

**7.4 Valuation of land:** It has been observed that while financing builders / contractors, certain banks valued the land for the purpose of security, on the basis of the discounted value of the property after it is developed, less the cost of development. This is not in conformity with established norms. In this connection, it is clarified that UCBs should not extend fund based / non-fund based facilities to builders / contractors for acquisition of land even as a part of a housing project. Further, wherever land is accepted as collateral, valuation of such land should be at the current market price only.

7.5 UCBs may also take collateral security, wherever available. As construction work progresses, contractors will get paid and such payments should be applied to reduce the balance in the borrowal accounts. If possible, banks could perhaps enter into a tripartite agreement with the borrower and his clients, particularly when no collateral securities are available for such advances.

7.6 It has been observed that some banks have introduced certain innovative Housing Loan Schemes in association with developers / builders, e.g., upfront disbursal of sanctioned individual housing loans to builders without linking the disbursals to various stages of construction of housing project, interest / EMI on the housing loan availed of by the individual borrower being serviced by the builders during the construction period / specified period, etc. In view of the higher risks associated with such lump-sum disbursal of sanctioned housing loans and customer suitability issues, UCBs are advised that disbursal of housing loans sanctioned to individuals should be closely linked to the stages of construction of the housing project / houses and upfront disbursal should not be made in cases of incomplete / under-construction / green field housing projects.

9.1 A number of cases have come to the notice of Reserve Bank, where unscrupulous persons have defrauded the banks by obtaining multiple bank finance against the same property by preparing a number of sets of the original documents and subm
