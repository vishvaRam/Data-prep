## <span id="page-4-0"></span>**3. Exposure Norms**

<span id="page-4-1"></span>3.1 Exposure Ceiling to Individual / Group Borrowers

3.1.1 UCBs are required to fix, with the approval of their Board of Directors, exposure ceiling in relation to their Tier-I capital. The exposure for the purpose shall comprise both credit exposure (loans and advances) and investment exposure (Non-SLR securities) as detailed at Para 2.3 and 2.4 so that -

(i) the exposure to an individual borrower does not exceed 15 per cent of Tier-I capital; and,

(ii) the exposure to a group of connected borrowers/parties does not exceed 25 per cent of Tier-I capital.

3.1.2 The exposure limits prescribed in Para 3.1.1 apply to all types of fresh exposures taken by UCBs after March 13, 2020 and UCBs were required to bring down their exposures which were in excess of the revised limits to within the aforesaid revised limits by March 31, 2023. However, where the existing exposure comprises only term loans and non-fund-based facilities, while no further exposure shall be taken on such borrowers, these facilities may be allowed to continue as per their respective repayment schedule / till maturity.

3.1.3 Whether borrowers / parties belong to a 'group of connected borrowers / parties' shall be determined based on the instructions contained at Para 2.5.1 and 2.5.2 above.

<span id="page-5-0"></span>3.2 Computation of exposure ceiling for individual / group borrowers

The exercise of computing the exposure ceilings may be conducted every year after the finalisation and audit of balance sheet of the bank and the exposure ceilings may be advised to the loan sanctioning authorities and the investment department in the bank. In view of the linking of shareholding to lending, accretion to or reduction in the share capital after the balance sheet date, may be taken into account for determining exposure ceiling at half-yearly intervals, with the approval of their Board of Directors. Accordingly, banks may, if they so desire, fix a fresh exposure limit taking into account the amount of share capital available as on 30th September. However, accretion to capital funds other than to share capital, such as half-yearly profit etc., will not be eligible for reckoning the exposure ceiling. Banks should also ensure that they do not take exposures in excess of ceiling prescribed in anticipation of infusion of capital on a future date.

#### <span id="page-5-1"></span>3.3 Thresholds for value of loans

UCBs shall have at least 50 per cent of their aggregate loans and advances comprising loans of not more than ₹25 lakh or 0.2 per cent of their Tier-I capital, whichever is higher, subject to a maximum of ₹1 crore, per borrower / party. Tier-I capital for this purpose shall be reckoned in the manner provided in paragraph 2.1 above. Notwithstanding the above, UCBs shall adhere to the exposure limits stipulated at Para 3.1 above. UCBs which do not, at present, comply with the prescribed threshold shall be in conformity with the above requirements by March 31, 2024. It is clarified that 'loans' for the purpose shall include all types of funded and non-funded exposures in the nature of credit.
