Dear Sir/ Madam,

# **Review of regulatory framework for HFCs and harmonisation of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs**

Please refer to the [circular DOR.NBFC \(HFC\).CC.No.118/03.10.136/2020-21 dated](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11988&Mode=0)  [October 22, 2020.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11988&Mode=0) In terms of para 4 of the above circular, it was advised that further harmonisation of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs will be taken up in a phased manner over the next two years to ensure that the transition is achieved with least disruption.

2. Since the transfer of regulation of HFCs from National Housing Bank (NHB) to Reserve Bank with effect from August 09, 2019, various regulations have been issued treating HFCs as a category of NBFCs. To be consistent with this policy stance and as stated in para 4 of the aforementioned circular, an analysis of regulations applicable to HFCs and NBFCs was undertaken, with an objective of harmonising these regulations, duly considering specialised nature of the HFCs.

3. Accordingly, based on a review of the extant regulations applicable to HFCs prescribed vide Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Company –](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) Housing [Finance Company \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2021,](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=12030) it has been decided to issue revised regulations as detailed in the [Part A of](#page-2-0) **Annex**. As part of the exercise, certain

regulations applicable to NBFCs have also been reviewed and revised regulations are detailed in [Part B of](#page-10-0) **Annex**. The revised regulations shall be applicable with effect from January 01, 2025.

# **Part A**

# **Section I: Guidelines regarding Acceptance of Public Deposits** *(applicable only to HFCs holding CoR to accept/ hold public deposits)*

1. Currently, HFCs accepting public deposits are subject to more relaxed prudential parameters on deposit acceptance as compared to NBFCs. Since the regulatory concerns associated with deposit acceptance are same across all categories of NBFCs, it has been decided to move HFCs towards the regulatory regime on deposit acceptance as applicable to deposit-taking NBFCs and specify uniform prudential parameters as prescribed under Master Direction – [Non-Banking Financial Companies](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563)  [Acceptance of Public Deposits \(Reserve Bank\) Directions, 2016.](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/BS_ViewMasDirections.aspx?id=10563) Accordingly, the revised regulations as stated in subsequent paragraphs would be applicable to HFCs accepting or holding public deposits.

## **Maintenance of a minimum percentage of liquid assets**

2. Currently, in terms of Section 29B of the NHB Act, 1987, deposit taking HFCs are required to maintain 13 per cent liquid assets against public deposits held by them. In exercise of powers conferred under Section 29B of NHB Act, 1987, it has now been decided that all deposit taking HFCs shall maintain, on an ongoing basis, liquid assets to the extent of 15 per cent of the public deposits held by them, in a phased manner as specified below:
