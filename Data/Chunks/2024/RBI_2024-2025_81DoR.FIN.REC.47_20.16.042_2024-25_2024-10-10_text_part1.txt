Dear Sir/ Madam,

## **Implementation of Credit Information Reporting Mechanism subsequent to cancellation of licence or Certificate of Registration**

The Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (CICRA) stipulates that only Credit Institutions (CIs) can furnish credit information to Credit Information Companies (CICs). Section 17(1) of CICRA mandates that CICs can collect credit information from its member CIs or member CICs only. Therefore, only the entities that are covered under the ambit of section 2(f) of CICRA, 2005 can submit credit information to CICs.

2. In view of the provisions of CICRA, entities whose licence or Certificate of Registration (CoR) has been cancelled by the Reserve Bank of India, can no longer be deemed as CIs under CICRA and their credit information cannot be accepted by the CICs. In such cases, repayment history of borrowers of these entities is not updated even if these borrowers continue to repay/ clear their dues.

3. In order to redress the hardship faced by such borrowers, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (vii) of section 2(f) and sub-section (1) of section 11 of CICRA, the Reserve Bank of India directs CICs and CIs to implement a credit information reporting mechanism subsequent to the cancellation of the licence/CoR of banks/ Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) as given in the [Annex.](#page-2-0)

4. These CIs shall continue to be governed by the provisions of CICRA, Rules and Regulations framed thereunder and directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India from time to time.

5. These instructions shall be implemented within six (6) months of the date of the circular.

Yours faithfully,

(J. P. Sharma) Chief General Manager
