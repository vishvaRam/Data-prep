3. The PCA Framework shall be applicable to all UCBs under Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4 categories except UCBs under All Inclusive Directions[1.](#page-0-0) Tier 1 UCBs, though not covered under the PCA Framework as of now, shall be subject to enhanced monitoring under the extant supervisory framework. The exemption of Tier 1 UCBs from the PCA Framework shall be reviewed in due course.

5. The provisions of the PCA Framework will be effective from April 1, 2025.

Such UCBs will be considered for an exit from SAF or to be placed under PCA on a case-by-case basis by the Reserve Bank of India.

7. A copy of this circular should be placed before the Board of Directors of your bank in its next meeting and a confirmation thereof should be sent to the office of the Senior Supervisory Manager concerned.

8. With effect from April 1, 2025, instructions contained in this circular shall supersede all earlier instructions issued on SAF.

## **PCA Framework for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks**

- A. Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability will be the key areas for monitoring in the revised PCA Framework.
- B. Indicators to be tracked for Capital, Asset Quality and Profitability would be CRAR, Net NPA Ratio (percentage of net NPA to net advances) and net profit, respectively.
- C. The PCA Framework would apply to all Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs) in Tier 2, Tier 3 and Tier 4, based on breach of risk thresholds of identified indicators.
- D. Breach of any risk threshold (as detailed under) may result in invocation of PCA.


\* For Tier 2 to 4 UCBs as per the glide path provided for achieving the regulatory minimum CRAR of 12% by March 31, 2026.

- E. A bank will generally be placed under PCA Framework based on the Reported/Audited Annual Financial Results and/or the ongoing Supervisory Assessment made by RBI. However, RBI may impose PCA on any bank during the course of a year (including migration from one threshold to another) in case the circumstances so warrant. Although supervisory action taken will primarily be based on the criteria specified under the PCA Framework, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking appropriate supervisory action in case stress is noticed in other important indicators/parameters or in case of serious governance issues. Also, the Reserve Bank will not be precluded from taking any supervisory action other than those indicated in this circular, based on the merits of each case.
- F. Exit from PCA and Withdrawal of Restrictions under PCA Once a bank is placed under PCA, taking the bank out of PCA Framework and/or withdrawal of restricti
