onthly statement for April 2024 transactions should be compiled and furnished to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers in the usual way. In order to distinguish the April 2024 (financial year 2024-25) and March Residual Transactions, the statement pertaining to March Residual Transactions should be clearly marked as "March Residual Account". The statement of March (Residual) Transactions should be sent by all Focal Point Branches to Zonal Accounts Officers/Pay and Accounts Officers latest by April 18, 2024.

Note: As advised in our Circular GA.NB.No.376/42.01.001/1995-96 dated May 22, 1996 all the cheques/amounts realized on or before March 31, 2024 should be treated as transactions relating to the current financial year as "March 2024 or March Residual Transactions", the reporting of which may take place during the month of April (upto April 10, 2024). But if any cheque is tendered on or before March 31, 2024 and realised on or after April 1, 2024, it will be treated as transaction for the next financial year as "April Transactions". Accordingly, the banks will prepare separate scrolls for March 2024 and April 2024 (Financial year 2024-25) transactions.
