RBI/2024-25/25 A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No.02

April 24, 2024

To,

The Authorised Dealer Category – I Banks

Madam / Sir,

## **Unauthorised foreign exchange transactions**

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has come across instances of unauthorised entities offering foreign exchange (forex) trading facilities to Indian residents with promises of disproportionate/exorbitant returns. On investigation, it has been observed that to facilitate unauthorised forex trading, these entities have taken recourse to engaging local agents who open accounts at different bank branches for collecting money towards margin, investment, charges, etc. These accounts are opened in the name of individuals, proprietary concerns, trading firms etc. and the transactions in such accounts are not found to be commensurate with the stated purpose for opening the account in several cases. It is also observed that these entities are providing options to residents to remit/deposit funds in Rupees for undertaking unauthorised forex transactions using domestic payment systems like online transfers, payment gateways, etc.

2. In this context, attention of Authorised Dealer Category-I (AD Cat-I) banks is invited to:

a) Section 3 (a) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, in terms of which, no person shall deal in or transfer any foreign exchange or foreign security to any person not being an 'Authorised Person', unless under general or special permission of the Reserve Bank;
